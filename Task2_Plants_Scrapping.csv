African Daisy,https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/annual/african-daisy/,"Arctotis","African Daisy","Annual","Sun","1 to 3 feet","2 to 3 feet","Seed, Stem Cuttings","African daisies are fairly drought-tolerant. For best growth, though, they need 1 inch of water per week from rainfall or irrigation. Maintain consistently moist soil that's well-drained and somewhat acidic with 5 or 5.5 pH. Add compost to the soil before planting.","Be careful not to overwater since soggy soil often leads to root rot. If it gets hot or dry, African daisies can stop growing. Additional water should solve the problem.","When grown in areas with hot summers, African daisies take a break from blooming and focus on surviving the stressful heat of the summer. Once things start to cool back down, they resume blooming and continue until frost. If you're planning on using African daisies in your garden, treat them as a cool season bloom.","Keep African daisies well-fed with a monthly application of balanced fertilizer, following manufacturer's instructions. Potted plants may require more frequent feeding.","To keep African daisies blooming all season, remove any old, spent blossoms from the plants. This will help encourage new growth and keep plants producing flowers longer. If plants become leggy, cut them back."
African Violet,https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/houseplant/african-violet/,"Saintpaulia ionantha","African Violet","Houseplant","Part Sun","2 to 6 inches","4 to 16 inches","Leaf Cuttings","African violets need a lightweight potting mix with a high amount of perlite, vermiculite, and sphagnum peat moss. You can also purchase a specially formulated African violet potting mix.","The soil should be moderately moist at all times. Plan to water your plants at least once a week in summer and more frequently in winter when the soil tends to dry quickly. Room temperature water is best.","The way you water African violets also matters. Overhead watering methods damage the foliage. When water droplets fall on the fuzzy leaves, they often leave behind ugly brown spots. Instead of watering from above, place pots in a shallow dish filled with about an inch of water. The plants will absorb water from the bottom. A baking pan or flat-bottom soup bowl is perfect for watering African violets. Leave the plants in the water tray for about 30 minutes.","African violets hail from moist, humid environments. In winter, the air in most homes doesn't have enough moisture for great growth and flowering. You can bump up the humidity around your plants by creating small water reservoirs. Fill a shallow tray, such as a pot saucer, with an inch or two of gravel. Add water to the tray so it is just below the surface of the gravel. Place your African violets right next to the gravel trays. The water will evaporate and humidify the atmosphere around your plants.","Use a fertilizer specially designed for African violets, which has a high phosphorus content to promote blooming. The nutrient concentrations vary greatly between brands; organic fertilizers typically have lower concentrations. Follow the label directions for frequency and amounts.","Remove any fading or shriveled leaves and flowers to encourage the development of more flowers."
Agapanthus,https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/bulb/agapanthus/,"Agapanthus","Agapanthus","Perennial","Part Sun, Sun","1 to 4 feet","1 to 3 feet","Division, Seed","Choose a location with rich soil that drains well. Agapanthus plants appreciate regular watering and don't like to dry out for long. Be consistent with watering to prevent stress from hindering future blooms, especially just after the plant completes a bloom cycle.","Many agapanthus species are evergreen in tropical climates. The non-evergreen types require a little more protection and warmth during the cool season. As fall arrives, initiate their dormancy by withholding some water. Move the more tender evergreen varieties into a frost-free environment, like a greenhouse or near a bright window in a home. Hardier plants can be left out and sparsely watered until spring. Agapanthus can handle high humidity but does not require it.","Since agapanthus plants are frequent bloomers, it's a good idea to fertilize them twice a year—in early spring and again two months later. Give them a balanced granular fertilizer such as 10-10-10 or one slightly higher in phosphorus than nitrogen to keep the blooms going all season long. for the amount to use, follow product label directions. Be sure to water it in well.","Remove damaged leaves any time of year, but leave all the others on the plant so it can store the energy it needs for the following year. For agapanthus grown in the ground, cut back the foliage to about 4 inches in late fall when blooming is over. The plant will go dormant for the winter. Mulch the crown of the plant to protect it.","During the blooming season, remove faded blossoms from the stem to encourage new growth and prevent the plant from wasting energy on seed production."

Some of the miniature varieties make great additions to trough gardens and containers. The biggest concern is that the plant doesn't get too wet because crown rot is a common problem. To prevent this, make sure to site your plants accordingly.","Ajuga plants are light feeders, and fertilization is not necessary. If you fertilize them at all, wait until late spring or early winter and use a slow-release granular fertilizer.","Crown rot can be a big problem for ajugas during warm, wet, or humid weather. It causes sudden wilting and yellowing of the ajuga, and the plants' stems turn black and rot. If this happens, remove and destroy the plant and the soil around it immediately to prevent the spread of this fungal disease. Disinfect your tools with a mixture of one-part bleach to nine-parts water to prevent transmitting the disease to other plants.","Like many garden plants, ajuga can be infested with aphids. Spray these insects off with a strong stream of water.","Ajuga is most easily propagated by division. In early spring or fall, use a sharp shovel to cut a section of stolon that contains nodes from an existing plant. Replant it, and soon roots and leaves grow to form a new plant. If you don’t have an existing plant to divide, sow seeds indoors in early spring. As the plants grow, move them to increasingly larger containers. Wait until summer to move them outside to the garden."
Allium,https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/bulb/allium/,"Allium","Allium","Perennial","Part Sun, Sun","6 to 12 inches","6 to 12 inches","Division, Seed","Because alliums generally form bulbs, they need well-drained soils. If their bulbs sit in water, they'll rot.","The fact that most alliums are bulbs works to their advantage. By storing water and nutrients, these plants are extremely drought tolerant and can survive long dry spells that might kill other plants without the benefit of a storage root. If you get plenty of rain (about an inch per week), there's no need to water allium—if you don't, water every three to five days.","When you choose allium plants, check their hardiness in your zone. Most are hardy in zones 4-10 and bloom before the hottest part of summer, so will do fine in a range of temperatures.","Add balanced fertilizer when your plants first start flowering. For the amount to use, follow product label directions. Otherwise, they don't need fertilizer in most soil.","When allium has finished blooming, removing spent blooms can encourage the plants to store more energy for next year's show, but it isn't necessary. Leaving the old flowers on can add interest as they dry (they look like miniature fireworks) and encourage reseeding if you're hoping to increase the number of allium plants in your garden."

Because of their fleshy tuberous roots, alstroemeria are likely to rot in too much water. They do appreciate consistent moisture, especially during flowering.","Once the plants are established, they can handle short droughts without a problem. The tubers allow the plants to store nutrients and water for times of need. This allows the plants to deal with drought and other stressful periods better than most.","When first planting alstroemeria, add a high-nitrogen fertilizer, such as a 12-4-8, to the top few inches of soil, following the product label directions. Fertilize established plants with a high-nitrogen water-soluble fertilizer in early spring to support blooming, casting it on the ground while avoiding the foliage of the plants. Follow the product information for amounts.","As with many garden plants, alstroemeria is susceptible to aphids, spider mites, whiteflies, snails and slugs. When they are planted in overly wet conditions, the plants are susceptible to root rot.","To prevent flopping, which is especially likely with older varieties and varieties grown for cut flowers, provide some sort of support or stake to hold up the tall stalks.","Tuberous roots mean that these plants are easy to divide when you want to expand your collection or share with friends. The plants form large colonies, so digging up and dividing the plants periodically helps keep the size of the colony in bounds. When dividing plants, make sure there are healthy tubers in the root ball, then replant and water well.","In general, alstroemeria don't appreciate having their roots disturbed often, so avoid dividing every year. With some of the more temperamental varieties, you may have wait a year or two after dividing before you get blooms again.","Growing alstroemeria is a great way to supply cut flowers from your garden with minimal care. It's best not to cut alstroemeria blooms from the stem as you would other cut flowers. Instead, pull the entire stem out of the plant. Simply grasp a flower stalk at its base near the ground and pull upward until the whole stem comes up from the ground.","This method encourages the plant to form new shoots at the base. Cutting the stem halfway down (like you might any other bloom) can slow the growth of the plant. Once you pull the whole stem up, cut the stalk to the length you need, remove any lower foliage that might be sitting directly in the water, and place it in a vase. You'll have blooms for weeks.","More than 120 species of alstroemeria produce blooms in colors of purple, red, orange, pink, yellow or white, some of which are striped or speckled with other colors."

Water this plant once or twice a week during dry spells, making sure it receives at least 1 inch of water each week. It needs water during germination and pollination but can do with less water for the rest of the season.","Foxtail amaranth grows best when the temperature is between 70°F and 82°F, but it tolerates a much wider range—from 45° to 100°F. This annual can't handle cold weather, though. Any temperature chillier than 40°F kills the plant. Average humidity is sufficient for the plant, although it is grown in the humid tropics successfully.","Foxtail amaranth plants don't need any supplemental fertilizer, but gardeners who want to fertilize their plants should use only organic fertilizers, such as a weekly spray of compost tea. This plant is intolerant of inorganic fertilizers, particularly those containing high amounts of nitrogen.","There is no need to prune this annual. Remove any damaged foliage as it occurs to discourage any pests or diseases that could take advantage of the situation. After the plant dies in winter, remove and discard the remaining foliage."

The extra organic matter keeps consistent moisture in the soil. Keeping the soil evenly moist is essential to prevent the foliage from drying up or the leaf edges from turning brown and crisp, especially in warm Southern climates.","Japanese anemone thrives in warm 70°F to 80°F but tolerates the cooler temperatures of fall, and it is hardy in USDA zones 4-8. It prefers average to moderate humidity.","This plant only needs to be fertilized twice a year: in the spring and again in the fall. Apply organic compost or a balanced fertilizer, such as a 10-10-10 formulation, following the package directions.","Japanese anemone plants that are overwintering in the garden will die back in cold weather. They benefit from a 2-inch layer of mulch. In the spring, gardeners should remove any old foliage before growth begins and deadhead the flowers in fall."

In the garden, angel’s trumpet plants need regular (not daily) watering. The plant’s leaves wilt when the soil is dry—a sure sign you need to start watering.","The plant thrives during summer’s warm days and cooler nights. It prefers a comfortable 60°F to 75°F location for the best blossom production. If the temperature falls much below this range, the plant won’t form buds. This South American native welcomes a humid environment.","Angel’s trumpet plants are heavy feeders that benefit from both liquid fertilizer, which dissipates quickly, and a slow-release granular fertilizer. Use a balanced (15-15-15) granular fertilizer for strong roots and a liquid bloom-specific fertilizer with a high phosphorus ratio of 7-9-5 for bloom production.","If you prefer to maintain a treelike look, remove the suckers that pop up at the plant’s base.

Use a soaker hose or trickle system to water the tree slowly and gently. You can also hold a garden hose (on a slow trickle) at the base of the tree and let the water slowly penetrate the entire root mass.","Once your arborvitae is established, periodically check the soil. Whenever the first inch of soil feels dry, give the tree a deep soaking by watering under the canopy, but several inches from the trunk of the tree. This avoids wasting water and helps prevent root rot from developing.","Arborvitaes grown in containers may need more frequent watering—possibly as often as daily in hot, dry conditions.","Some arborvitae types are more cold-tolerant than others, but many can tolerate moist temperatures as low as -30 or -40°F. If you live in a colder climate (zones 2 through 4), you will want to stick with Thuja occidentalis or eastern arborvitae (as opposed to Western arborvitae (Thuja plicata) as they are slightly more cold-tolerant.","In the winter, it is normal for some browning and needle dropping to occur, but if your tree has progressive browning that is isolated to one side (usually the windward side), it may be winter burn. This happens for many reasons, including delayed winter dormancy, sudden temperature changes, frozen soil, and a shallow root system that can’t take up enough water to nourish the needles. You can prune away dead or damaged limbs as new growth emerges in the spring. If the entire tree has turned brown, it may not be salvageable.","Arborvitaes do not require fertilizer to thrive, but if you would like to encourage more lush foliage or faster growth, you can apply a nitrogen-rich, slow-release fertilizer once a year in the spring.","Since heavy snow can break branches, brush them off after a storm. Broken limbs should be pruned, and the plants may need to be staked upright until they recover.","Prune arborvitae in the spring for thick foliage. Only trim where leaves grow, not back to the base of the plant. If there are dead branches, they should be removed."

It's better to water deeply less often to force the roots to grow to reach the water. Keeping about 6 inches away from the tree trunk, mulch with about 3 to 6 inches of coarse bark or cocoa bean hulls to retain moisture.","If you live in a warm enough hardiness zone, you can plant outdoors. Avocados perform best in temperatures between 60°F to 85°F in areas with medium or high humidity.","In summer, fertilize weekly with a fertilizer with nitrogen, indicated by a higher first number, such as 7-4-2. Avocados also need a small amount of zinc, so look for a fertilizer with that component. Avoid fertilizing during the winter when growth is minimal.","Prune the tree regularly. Every time it grows another 6 inches tall, cut back the top two sets of leaves. When the plant reaches 12 inches, cut it back to 6 inches.

Remove any leaves or buds from the bottom half of the cutting, dip it in rooting hormone, and insert it into a pot filled with sterile rooting medium. Add water and place a clear plastic bag over the pot.","Mist the cutting occasionally to keep the medium moist but not wet. Four to six weeks later, test the cutting by tugging gently on a leaf. If you feel resistance, the cutting has rooted. When it has rooted, remove the plastic bag and continue to grow it in a protected area for about a year. Fall is the best time to plant the shrub outside in the garden or landscape.","Seeds: Harvest several berries in late summer. Mash the berries and soak them in water overnight to remove the pump. Discard seeds that float to the top and spread the remaining seeds on a paper towel to dry, making sure all the pulp is removed. Fill 4-inch pots with seed-starting mix and moisten it. Sow two seeds per pot about 1/2 inch deep and add water. Wrap the pots in plastic wrap, creating several holes for ventilation, and put them in the refrigerator for four to eight weeks to cold-stratify the seeds, watering when the medium feels dry.","Take the pots from the refrigerator and remove the plastic. Set them on a warming mat or in a warm location. The seeds germinate about five weeks later. If both seeds in a pot germinate, remove the smaller of the two.

So don't be afraid to let your plants dry out a little between waterings, including those in container gardens.","Early morning is the ideal time to give these annuals a drink. Avoid watering during times of day with intense sunlight, as this can lead to leaf scorch. Using a soaker hose and watering at the base of your begonias can reduce the risk of fungal diseases.","Most varieties grow best in warm temperatures and humid conditions. Wax begonias—the most popular type—are tender in the cold, so it's essential to plant them after the last frost.","Tuberous begonias should be dug up each year and replanted come spring, since they won't survive in the cold. Unlike wax begonias, these types won't thrive in hot, humid conditions, preferring cooler temperatures. Similarly, rhizomatous begonias like milder climates.","No matter where you plant begonias, it's smart to give them a regular dose of fertilizer, ideally well-diluted, to fuel the barrage of blooms they're bound to throw at you. Look for one that's equal parts nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium; add it to the soil when you first plant your begonias.","If you want to encourage an abundance of flowers, switch to a fertilizer with more phosphorous than nitrogen once blossoms appear, applying it monthly. However, if pretty foliage is your priority, you can stick with a balanced fertilizer. A controlled-release formula will reduce the odds of burning your begonias. (Rex begonias are particularly prone to this.)","For tuberous begonias, administer a diluted high-nitrogen fertilizer every two weeks, starting at the first flowering and continuing until the end of May. Then begin using a balanced or low-nitrogen formula. Stop fertilizing tuberous types around the end of August; that way, they'll go dormant and you can dig them up for winter storage.","Begonias are self-cleaning, meaning there's no need to remove (or "deadhead") old blossoms during the growing season.

Soil pH requirements vary from species to species, though most tend to perform well in neutral soil.","While you should follow the care instructions on your plant's label, there are some general watering guidelines. After planting, water your bellflower at least once a week, keeping the soil damp about an inch below the surface. Early morning is the best time to give your bellflower a drink. That way, the leaves can dry off as the temperature rises.","For most varieties, warm days and cool nights yield the best growth. Some species won't survive long if nighttime temperatures stay above 70℉ and conditions are humid. In regions where daytime temperatures are high, certain types may do better in partial sun, rather than full sun.","If you notice new growth on your bellflower, it may benefit from a light application of fertilizer. When using granular formulations, avoid the leaves and crown to protect the plant from burns. Slow-release fertilizers should be used sparingly, because these can promote root rot in bellflowers.","Deadheading, or removing spent blossoms, can encourage some species to produce more flowers. This can be a slow process, as you should remove each blossom individually to avoid accidentally taking off new buds on the same stalk. Make sure to do your research: Some varieties shouldn't be deadheaded after the first flush, since new flowers will soon follow. As summer progresses, you may want to trim off any foliage that is past its prime.","Bellflowers aren't usually pest-prone, though they may occasionally have issues with aphids, snails, slugs, spider mites, thrips, or whiteflies.","Rust may appear as light-colored leaf spots and red-orange pustules on the underside of leaves. This is more likely to occur when conditions are damp. Water bellflowers at the base to reduce the risk of this disease, and remove any infected sections, destroying them so the disease can't spread.","Powdery mildew, which looks like white or gray powder on leaves, is a fungal disease that may affect bellflowers.

Snow serves as an insulator, but the weight of a lot of snow can damage the plants, so brush it off regularly.","In general, boxwood tolerates a wide range of humidity. It grows in 10 percent humidity and 90 percent humidity, and everything in between.","Use an all-purpose fertilizer once each spring, following the manufacturer's directions.","Regular annual trimming allows you to maintain a shaped plant with little fuss. Trimming is best done during late winter or early spring, just before the big annual flush of new growth. This prevents too much tender growth in the fall that may burn come winter and promotes good branching of the new growth for a nice, full shrub.","When choosing a boxwood for topiary purposes, the particular variety dictates what shape the plant will be best for, so check the growth habit of your specific type. For example, some boxwoods are naturally rounded, some are low and spreading, some are more conical, and some are upright. The growth rate is also important to consider. Many dwarf varieties are slow-growing, so if you plan on making a hedge, you'll need to plan to space accordingly. Others may be fast-growing, and if you plan on making intricate-shaped topiaries, they may outgrow their shape too quickly and require additional maintenance."

To produce the most blooms, water your newly planted calendulas frequently until they are established. After that, give your plants about 1 to 2 inches of water weekly and adjust accordingly if you have a lot of rainfall or especially dry weather.","Calendulas prefer mild sunny weather with temperatures between 60 and 80° Fahrenheit but don’t like very hot or very cold climates. When summer temps rise above 85, your calendulas won’t die, but they are likely to stop blooming—at least until cooler fall temperatures arrive. You can prolong the summer blooming season by planting your calendula in an area with protection from the high afternoon sun. Frost will kill calendulas but—if the seed pods are not deadheaded or harvested—the plants may self-seed and return the following spring when conditions are favorable.","High humidity increases the chance of root rot or fungal disease in calendulas. To prevent this from happening, give each of your calendula plants ample air circulation by planting them at least 8 to 16 inches apart.","Calendulas need little to no fertilizer to thrive—especially when they are planted in fertile, well-draining soil. That said, if your soil conditions are poor, your calendulas may benefit from a dose of diluted, water-soluble, balanced fertilizer at the beginning of the bloom season. Feed your plants sparingly, though, as overfertilization causes calendulas to bloom less and grow bushier.","As your young calendula plants are developing, you can encourage compact, bushy growth, by pinching back the long stems. When the plants are several inches tall (but not yet flowering), grasp the center stem between your thumb and forefinger and pinch until the top of the stem pops off and the remaining stem is even with any side growth.","Deadheading of calendulas isn’t required but doing so regularly will reduce unwanted self-seeding and encourage your plants to produce more flowers before the bloom season ends."

Keep the soil moist by adding 3 inches of mulch, which also helps to suppress weeds.","Camellias prefer cooler temperatures but will be harmed by frost. Plant camellias in north-facing locations with a wind guard like a wall or a building to protect them from damage. In spring, 50 degrees is ideal for camellias, while winters should remain between 40 and 50 degrees with sunlight. They thrive in a more humid environment, one reason they're hardy in Zones 6-10.","There are fertilizers specifically for camellias and azaleas. Use one to manage the soil acidity.

Hot summer weather is not conducive to growing carrots; they tend to become bitter and less sweet. Carrots are cold-hardy but will get damaged or die in temperatures below 20 degrees F. ","They don’t have any particular humidity requirements.","Carrots are heavy feeders and need regular fertilization. Use a fertilizer that is high in phosphorus and potassium and low in nitrogen and follow the label instructions for amounts and frequency.","It is sometimes recommended to prune the carrot tops in order to let the plant direct its energy into growing larger roots instead of foliage. There is no evidence that supports this practice."," ","Carrots are susceptible to different blights such as Alternaria blight and Cercospora blight. Proper crop rotation is an important step in preventing these fungal diseases.","Carrot rust flies are a serious pest of carrots.

Another potential carrot pest is wireworms, soil-borne insects that are often found in soil high in organic matter.","Carrots are grown from seed. They are biennials (they only produce seeds in their second year) so in order to collect your own seed, you will need to dedicate a few plants to seed production and let them overwinter. Note that the seeds of varieties that are not open-pollinated won’t produce carrots true to the parent. For that reason, it is usually easier and more convenient to buy fresh seed from a seed company every year. Follow the instructions for planting carrots above.","Begin pulling carrots as soon as they develop their full color. There are two indicators that tell you whether the carrots are ready: the size of the aboveground greens and the size of the shoulders (the top section of the carrot root). Follow these tips for determining carrot maturity and harvesting.","For winter storage, wait to harvest until after the tops have been exposed to several frosts, as the cold will increase their sweetness.

There are three main classes when it comes to pruning, numbered accordingly. The group numbers indicate how to prune. To start, no matter which group number vine you have, it's always a good idea to give plants in their first year a good spring pruning.","Group 1 plants will bloom on old wood (growth from previous seasons), so if needed, prune them right after blooming. Clean up these vines lightly in early spring, but be aware that any live growth you remove is, in fact, a potential flower you've just cut. Try to only cut off dead wood.","Group 2 vines bloom on both new and old growth. Typically, most of their blooms will appear in spring, but they'll also put on another floral show on new growth in the fall. With this group of clematis, you can do some mild pruning in early spring, especially removing dead wood. Any major work should be done just after the primary bloom in spring.","Group 3 vines all bloom only on new wood. These types of clematis vines are easy to grow and can be cut back every spring to about 8-12 inches above the ground. If you don't cut Group 3 back each spring, plants can become overgrown and unruly.","You can propagate clematis with seeds by planting them in a flat of seed-starting mix and keeping it moist, but it can take several months before you see any results.","Taking softwood stem cuttings from a healthy plant in April or May is a better method for propagating clematis. The cutting must contain a leaf bud. Press the cuttings into a small pot filled with compost or seed-starting mix, water, and cover with a plastic bag. When they root, transfer them to separate containers. It can take as long as a year for the seedlings to be robust enough to be planted outdoors."

Once dill plants start growing, they need about 1 to 2 inches of rain or additional water per week to thrive.","The best temperature for dill is around 70ºF, although it's cold-hardy to as low as 25ºF.","When temperatures rise, dill tends to bolt and send up flower stalks to set seeds. Once this annual herb flowers and sets seeds, it dies. Keep the plant going for an extended growing season by removing the flowers.","Most herbs, including dill, don't need additional fertilizer, but you can apply a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer once or twice during the growing season. Use a liquid fertilizer mixed with water, or scratch a time-release fertilizer into the ground at planting time. For the amount to use, follow product label instructions.","Prune dill early in the season to keep it from becoming leggy. Snip off the top leaves of the plant, which encourages lower leaves to grow more abundantly. Anything that's pruned can be used for prepping and cooking food."

Water plants regularly during the first growing season to promote a robust root system. They should get at least 1 inch of water per week from rain or watering. Dogwoods like more acidic and moist, well-drained soil. Enhance soil with a humus additive.","Dogwood can tolerate almost any kind of temperature, but they don't do well in high heat and humidity. Protect them from the hottest part of the day by planting them where they'll receive morning sun and afternoon shade.","There's no need to fertilize dogwood shrubs, but if you want to, do so in the early spring, following the fertilizer manufacturer's instructions.","Dogwood shrubs don't require frequent pruning, but you can intensify winter stem color by regularly removing older canes so that young woody stems can show off their bright red, yellow, or orange-red winter colors.","Cut back one-third of the oldest, most faded stems in early spring. Remove damaged or dead stems at the same time. Each subsequent spring cut back another third of the branches. When the pruned dogwood bush emerges from dormancy in the spring, you'll see an increased number of colorful stems appearing as a result.","If dogwood shrubs develop fungi such as leaf blight or canker, the infected branches and leaves should be cut off and thrown away to keep the fungus from spreading. Sawfly larvae can chew big chunks from leaves. Other pests include scale and bagworms. Though they won't do much damage, they can be eliminated with insecticide.","Dogwood shrubs can be propagated easily with stem cuttings. In the spring before the buds start to open, take 12” cuttings from 1-year-old wood of the dogwood shrub. Each cutting needs at least three pairs of buds. Remove the leaves from the bottom half of the cutting. Moisten the end of each cutting and dip it into rooting hormone. In a small but deep pot filled with a sterile medium, such as sand or perlite, make a hole and plant the cutting deep enough to cover two pairs of buds. Press down on the medium so that the cutting stands straight. Keep the medium moistened and cover the pot and cutting with a clear plastic bag, using wooden sticks to keep the bag off the cutting, if needed.","After a couple of weeks, check the cutting once a week for evidence of rooting by giving the stem a slight tug or looking to see if roots are coming through the pot's drain hole. After about eight weeks, the cutting should begin to root. When it does, remove the plastic bag entirely. Keep the pot in a warm area with bright light but not full sun, and wait as the cutting develops a robust root system."

Heavy mulch helps these plants thrive in both summer heat and winter cold.","Dogwood has shallow roots, so water them twice a week to keep them healthy, or more when it's particularly dry. Water deeply. Water more frequently if the leaves become light green or dry. If the leaves look gray or droopy, cut back on watering.","Dogwood are quite cold-tolerant, and can easily survive winter freezes. Dogwood prefers cooler to warmer temperatures, and if grown in more arid climates, dogwood requires consistent shade and more frequent waterings than in cooler climates.","When first planting dogwood, avoid over-fertilizing, which can be damaging to young trees. Use a nitrogen product in the beginning, following manufacturer's instructions. Once your tree is established, use an organic mix for acidic soil, but only fertilize if the ground isn't already nutrient-rich.","As a rule, dogwood trees don't need much maintenance, but pruning may be occasionally required to shape the plant. Summer is the ideal time to prune since the plant experiences a heavy sap flow during winter and spring."

Water at least once a week if potted, and check that soil is dry before watering outdoors.","When growing eucalyptus indoors, use any general-purpose well-draining potting media and make sure the container you use has ample drainage.","Eucalyptus do well in moderate temperatures, between 65ºF and 75ºF. If the temperatures dip below 50ºF, they suffer, so if you're growing them in pots, bring them indoors if they're outside. A bit of humidity is good for eucalyptus plants.","Use a low-nitrogen fertilizer, following manufacturer's instructions, for indoor eucalyptus plants or outdoor plants in containers. Trees and plants in your yard won't need fertilizer.","There are several methods for pruning eucalyptus depending on your needs and which species you are growing.","One method—coppicing—involves cutting the tree or shrub back to almost ground level occasionally to stimulate growth. This method, which is particularly effective for E. gunnii and E. globulus cultivars, keeps the foliage in the juvenile stage, encourages new stems each year, and helps manage the size of the plant. To coppice your eucalyptus, cut back all the stems (to about 6 to 12 inches from the ground) using angled cuts in late winter or early spring. In the early stages, it may take more than one season for new growth to return, but after years of regular coppicing, vibrant new growth should return each season. The cuttings from coppiced eucalyptus plants are excellent for drying or using in floral arrangements.","If you are pruning your eucalyptus to form a shrub or hedge, cut back about one-third of the plant’s height at the end of its second growing season. After each subsequent growing season, you will only need to remove about a quarter of the plant’s height to maintain a reasonable size and shape.","If you are growing eucalyptus as a tree, it won’t need much pruning beyond the occasional removal of dead leaves and branches. You can, however, begin pruning some of the lower branches (after the tree is at least 2 years old) if you would like to create a more defined canopy when the tree reaches maturity. You can also cut eucalyptus branches from your tree to use in floral arrangements or for their aromatic properties.","For potted eucalyptus, you can snip off unruly or overgrown ends as necessary, but avoid doing any major pruning until spring.

If you're planting your euphorbia in containers, a standard cacti/succulent potting mix should do just fine.","When it comes to watering your euphorbia, keep an eye on how moist the soil is feeling. You'll want to wait to water your plant until the top few inches of soil are completely dry. Euphorbia plants generally only need consistent watering when they're actively growing during the spring, summer, and fall. During the winter months, you only have to water when the plant shows signs of wilting.","Euphorbia plants are fairly adaptable to a variety of temperatures, though many species definitely prefer the warmer temperatures of late spring and summer. Most euphorbias grow well in temperatures as low as 50°F, though some can even tolerate a light frost.","Humidity needs vary from species to species for euphorbia, but regardless of tolerance, these plants need good ventilation thanks to their dense shape. Be sure to space your euphorbia plants out from one another and surrounding plants to lower the risk of fungal diseases, especially in wet or humid climates.","Fertilizer needs will depend on which euphorbia species you're growing. However, nearly all types will benefit from a light feeding in early spring at the beginning of their growing season. These plants do best with a mild, balanced organic fertilizer—alternatively, you can mix in compost a few times throughout the spring and summer. Euphorbias in containers may need more frequent feedings than those planted in the ground.","The type of pruning your euphorbia plant needs will depend on the specific species—there are some, like evergreen euphorbias, that need to have their spent blooms removed, while others should be cut down to the ground each autumn. Research the needs of the exact species you've planted before proceeding with any pruning.","Protective gear is necessary when pruning euphorbia.

If you experience prolonged temperatures above 80 degrees Fahrenheit and don’t have trees or structures to protect your evening primrose plants from the harshest afternoon sun, they may also suffer damage.","Evening primroses prefer a dry to only moderately humid environment. Prolonged high humidity may cause your plants to develop fungal infections and rot.","Evening primrose can grow even in poor, rocky soil, so most varieties will not require fertilization—especially in their native climates. If you want to encourage more prolific flowering, apply a liquid fertilizer that is high in phosphorus, following product label instructions, or amend your soil with organic material before planting.","It is not necessary to prune your evening primroses to maintain basic plant health, but you can cut them back after blooming if you wish to prevent self-seeding. Just pinch or snip off the fading flowers before they go to seed and discard the blooms in a trash bag. Do not toss them on the ground or in a compost bin.","Aphids, leafhoppers, and spider mites are common pests for evening primrose plants. If you spot them, spray them off with soapy water. Slugs and snails are also common visitors to evening primrose plants, but they can be deterred with traps, bait, or abrasives like eggshells, dry ash, or diatomaceous earth. You may occasionally spot beetles dining on the leaves of your evening primrose plant, but they are unlikely to cause significant damage.","If your evening primrose plants are placed in an area with poor drainage, they may be susceptible to root rot, crown rot, and fungal infections. If any of these develop, your plants might still be salvageable. Before tossing them, amend your soil with compost or relocate the plants to an area with better drainage.","The easiest way to propagate evening primrose is via seed—and if you already have plants, you don’t need to buy seeds. You can harvest them straight from your existing plants when the seed pods turn brown and papery. Just be sure to capture them before the seed pods open and spill the seeds to the ground. Freshly harvested seeds can be planted immediately in the fall or you can save them until spring and cold-stratify them before sowing them in the ground.","Some evening primrose plants can also be divided. Oenothera macrocarpa (or big fruit evening primrose), doesn’t take well to it, but others may benefit from an occasional division. To do so, carefully dig up a root system and slice the roots apart into equal sections with a sharp, sterile blade. Plant each new section at least 6 to 12 inches apart."

Don't fertilize at all in the fall or winter. Also, don't fertilize newly planted shrubs for the first year.","Forsythias have a graceful natural growth habit that can be ruined with improper pruning. Because most varieties on the market today are a hybrid of a weeping type and a more upright shrub, they tend to have a slightly weeping habit that some may perceive as messy. To fix this, people tend to shear their forsythias, which works fine, but as new growth comes, it tends to be even messier. Sheared forsythias benefit from regular shaping to maintain a neat habit. This should be done right after blooming to prevent removing any future buds.","The best way to maintain forsythias and conserve their original habit is by selectively pruning out old wood after blooming. Remove any branches that look old and woody at the base of the plant. This will encourage the plant to branch at the base, preventing erratic new growth from cut stems. If plants are truly out of control or just messy, forsythias can be refreshed with a harsh rejuvenation pruning. This can be done by cutting back the entire shrub to just above ground level. Harsh pruning encourages the whole plant to re-flush and can bring back its old habit.","Forsythia shrubs are somewhat resistant to insect damage, although they can fall prey to aphids, spider mites, and the fourlined plant bug. If this happens, an application of insecticidal soap or neem oil should handle the problem.","Gardeners might not be as familiar with another affliction forsythia shrubs may experience—forsythia gall disease, which displays as bumpy deformities that appear on the stems and weaken them. It is likely the result of a bacterial or fungal infection spread by sucking insects. At this point, there is no treatment. Prevention includes buying plants from a reputable seller, disinfecting pruning shears before using them and afterward, spacing the plants for good airflow, and watering at soil level to keep the leaves dry.","Layering and cuttings are the two best (and easiest) ways to propagate a forsythia shrub.","Layering: Fill a large pot with potting soil and place it close to the shrub. Pick a stem that is long enough to bend down and reach the pot with a foot to spare. Scrape the stem about 10 inches from the tip and bury the scraped part 2 inches in the pot of soil, leaving the rest of it above the soil line. Don't cut it off the stem! You may need to use a rock or another weight to hold the stem down in the pot. Keep the potting soil moist. After roots form, cut the stem reaching from the parent plant to the pot. This process is so easy that the plant may do it by itself. Look under and around an existing forsythia for tiny volunteer shrubs.","Cuttings: In midsummer, take a 6-inch cutting from the tip of a stem from the current year's growth. Remove the leaves from the bottom half of the cutting and dip the end into rooting hormone. Fill a small pot with perlite and make a hole with a pencil. Insert the cutting, firm up the medium, and water it well. Cover the pot with a clear plastic bag and seal it. Put it in a warm place, but not in direct sun. After a few days, unseal the bag to let in fresh air and don't reseal it. Roots should develop in six to eight weeks.

Once established, the trees are drought-tolerant and don't usually require watering to survive. However, they'll grow fastest and look best if given supplemental water during a drought.","When first planted, water regularly for one to two years. After they're established, water once a week or more, depending on how dry the soil gets.","Foxtail palm requires warm temperatures and plenty of humidity, which is why it's well suited for South Florida. Temperatures should not go below 60ºF for them to stay healthy.","When grown as a houseplant, foxtail palm grows best in the 65°F to 85°F range and needs the most light possible. This tropical plant loves humidity and benefits from added humidity indoors, such as provided by a humidifier. Foxtail palm is challenging to grow indoors unless you have a greenhouse.","Keep the fronds looking lush and dark green by applying a fertilizer formulated for palms in the spring. Follow the directions on the product packaging for application rates.","Spreading a 3- to 4-inch-deep layer of mulch over the soil at planting time helps cut back on competition from weeds and protects the trunks from a lawn mower or string trimmer damage.","Because foxtail palms are self-cleaning, there's rarely a need to prune their leaves."

Once they start sprouting, water moderately in the absence of rain to keep the soil lightly moist. Once the summer heat sets in, freesia will go dormant and should not be watered any longer.","Freesia are hardy in zones 9 and 10. In zone 8 and below, their corms won’t survive the winter chill, so they need to be grown as an annual. Cool springtime temperatures between 55 and 60 degrees are prime time for freesia. While they tolerate humid conditions, they stop blooming and go dormant in temperatures over 70 degrees F.","When the young plants are about 6” tall, begin fertilizing every 2 weeks with a liquid fertilizer according to manufacturer's directions. ","Freesia does not require pruning but after they bloom, it is crucial to let the narrow, bladelike leaves turn yellow, wilt, and shrivel completely before removing them.

Before planting them in the ground, test your soil pH levels to ensure they are between 5.0 and 6.0. If your soil leans more alkaline, you will need to amend the soil or consider a different location.","Despite their fussiness over well-draining soil, gardenias are not drought tolerant. So, it is important to keep the soil around your gardenia consistently moist (but not wet). Plan to give your plants at least an inch of water per week (or more during dry spells) and don’t let the soil dry out between waterings. Adding a layer of mulch may help retain soil moisture and prevent weeds from creeping in and competing for nutrients.","Gardenias are native to tropical and subtropical climates, so they prefer temperatures between 60-70 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and 60-65 degrees Fahrenheit at night.","Gardenias also prefer their ambient humidity levels consistently above 60%. This makes growing gardenias as a houseplant challenging. If you plan to grow yours indoors, you may need to use a humidifier or mister near your gardenia plant to keep the air moist.","If you are growing your gardenias in the ground, plan to fertilize them in early spring and again in early summer with an acid-rich fertilizer that can be easily absorbed by the plant’s roots. A good bet is to look for a fertilizer designed for other acid-loving plants like camellias, rhododendrons, or blueberries. Err on the side of under-feeding and stop fertilization in the fall to allow the plant to slow growth before entering dormancy.","Container-grown gardenias may need to be fed every few weeks during the active growing season but should also avoid getting fertilizer in the fall and winter. It's best to use acidic-based fertilizers and also keep in mind that water affects the soil's acidity.","Gardenias don’t need much pruning, but you can cut them back a little every two years to maintain their shape. Wait until the blooming season ends and then use sharp, sterile shears to cut back some of the foliage as well as the green and woody growth. You can cut the plant back by as much as two-thirds."

If your soil is heavy, incorporate compost, peat or perlite into it. If you are planting geraniums in containers, use commercial topsoil and mix in sand and a little peat moss for the best drainage. Good drainage is essential.","Wait until the top inch of soil is dry to water the geranium plants. Watering once or twice a week, depending on the season and weather, is usually sufficient.","Annual geraniums are heavy feeders. The plants need to be fertilized once or twice a week with a liquid product to support flower production, especially when they are planted in containers. Outside of bloom season, applying a balanced, slow-release granular fertilizer every four to six weeks is sufficient. Follow the product label for the amount to use.","Some geraniums, particularly the ivy variety, suffer from a condition called edema on the underside of the leaves. When soil temperatures are warm and wet and air temperature is cooler and humid, plants take up more water than they can hold, which causes the leaf cells to stretch and become damaged with scabs that turn brown and bumpy. This isn't contagious, and damaged leaves can be removed.","Stem cuttings are the best way to propagate geraniums. To take a stem cutting, cut the stem just above a node (which encourages new growth on the parent plant). On your cutting, locate another node several inches away from the original cut and cut beneath it. Ideally, the cutting should be 4 to 6 inches long. Remove the leaves except for any at the top. Press the cutting into warm, moist planting medium. Then, water and place in indirect light. Within a couple of weeks, the plant will begin sending out roots.","Annual geraniums come in different types: zonal, ivy, and regal. The most common of the annual variety, zonal geraniums, is the most recognizable geranium; it gets its name from the broad band of darker coloring on its leaves. In some, this "zone" is more pronounced than in others. If you don't see this banding on the leaves but the flowers look like a zonal geranium, it could be a variety for which this coloring is not present or a seed geranium (the latter of which is a more inexpensive version of its zonal counterpart).","Zonal geraniums are grown from cuttings only and have been bred for traits like bigger and longer-lasting blooms, sterility (so that the plants don't waste energy on making seeds), and overall vigor and disease resistance. Zonal geraniums also thrive in the heat and sun of the summer and bloom all season if you remove old blooms.","Ivy geraniums are another popular variety, and as the name implies, these plants have more of a trailing habit with segmented leaves like ivy. Overall, blooms of the ivy types are similar to the zonals but with smaller bloom clusters and deeper purple flowers. Ivy geraniums take heat well but not quite as well as their zonal counterparts. If it is exceptionally hot, ivy geraniums will thank you for a little afternoon shade.","Regal geraniums, another popular plant variety, are grown for their large, extremely showy blooms. These fancy flowers come in many colors and have beautiful patterns you don't see in other types of geraniums. Regal types are probably some of the pickiest geraniums. They prefer a cooler growing season and will stop blooming in high summer heat. Make sure they have well-drained soil and keep them cool when the steamy temps arrive."

If planting ginger in the ground, add plenty of compost to help retain water and improve drainage. If growing it in a container, use a high quality potting mix.","As your ginger plant grows, its rhizomes may become exposed on the soil surface; covering them with compost or potting soil will protect them from sun scorch and encourage more rhizome development. Keep the soil evenly moist. Never let the soil dry out completely, but avoid overwatering, which may cause rhizomes to rot. Outdoors, a layer of mulch will help keep soil evenly moist. Reduce watering as you approach harvest time (as leaves begin to die back).","Ginger is a tropical plant and thrives in a warm, humid environment, so your best bet is to try to mimic these conditions. It grows very well as an outdoor container plant where summers are hot and humid, with temperatures remaining between 60 and 90°F. Bring potted plants indoors before temperatures drop below 55°F. ","Ginger is a heavy feeder. Incorporate a slow-release fertilizer into the garden soil or potting soil at planting time. Apply a liquid fertilizer such as fish emulsion, or kelp every 3 to 4 weeks. ","Baby ginger is usually harvested 5 to 8 months after planting; rhizomes are thin-skinned, white with a pink tint. Mature ginger, with its tan outer skin, is harvested 9 to 10 months after planting. To harvest, remove the plant from its pot or dig up the entire plant from the ground. Knock off as much soil as possible then rinse rhizomes thoroughly under running water. Break the rhizomes into sections and allow them to air dry before storing your ginger root. They can be kept in the refrigerator for a few weeks, or placed in a plastic bag in the freezer for up to 5 months. Rhizomes can also be dehydrated. ","Although ginger rarely encounters problems with pests, mealybugs, spider mites, and aphids sometimes infest plants. These can usually be removed (or their damage minimized) with a hard spray of cold water. You may need to repeat this treatment a few times.","Too much sun will burn leaves and lack of water will cause leaves to brown, so locate plants where they receive indirect light indoors and some shade outside. Do not allow soil to dry out. Overwatering can cause rhizomes to rot so be sure to use a soil with excellent drainage and a pot that has an adequate drainage hole. Do not let the soil get soggy.","Use a piece of a plump rhizome with at least two eyes to start a new plant. It’s best to use ginger root from an organic market or supplier because some grocery store ginger is treated with a growth inhibitor to prevent sprouting. If using ginger root from the grocery store, soak it overnight in water to remove or dilute the growth inhibitor. After harvesting the rhizomes, you can replant a section of the rhizome to start a new ginger plant.","In addition to the common ginger (Zingiber officinale) found in grocery stores, there are several less common species of Zingiber with culinary, medicinal, or ornamental uses. Pinecone ginger (Z. zerumbet), native to India and Southeast Asia is also called shampoo flower. A fragrant liquid can be extracted from the yellow flower which is used as an ingredient in shampoos and hair conditioners. Beehive or Malaysian ginger (Z. spectabile) is used medicinally to treat inflammation and headaches, and as a food preservative.","Because ginger grows best in part shade, good choices for ornamental outdoor companions—either in ground or in containers—include impatiens, coleus, and bedding begonia.  The deep green leaves of ginger serve as a foil for the colorful leaves of coleus or the flowers of impatiens and begonia. And ginger’s upright habit provides a pleasing contrast to rounded or mounding habits of the ornamental annuals."

Warm, dry conditions produce the most and best fruit. Humidity and cool conditions slow growth and fruiting. Expect goji berry to continue fruiting into fall in most areas. The first frost in fall will halt fruit production. ","No fertilizer is required to grow goji berries. Researchers have found that berries growing in infertile, sandy soil do benefit from incorporating organic fertilizers and compost into the soil at planting time and annually in spring to improve both the nutrient availability and the soil structure. ","No pruning is needed the first year after planting. Beginning in year two, plan to prune goji berries annually in winter. The main purpose of pruning is to encourage new, vigorous growth. Goji berries fruit on new growth. Start by removing any weak, damaged, or crossing branches. Shorten lateral branches by cutting them back by 6 to 18 inches. Reduce overall plant height to keep harvesting manageable. ","After about 3 years, plants often begin to send up suckers from the root system. If left alone, the plant can spread quickly. Dig up the shoots and discard them or transplant them if you want to expand your fruit production. ","Squirrels and birds will forage ripe berries. Place netting over the shrub to preserve fruit. Deer and rabbits will eat young stems and leaves. Uses fencing to protect plants as necessary. Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that produces patches of white powder on leaves and stems during humid conditions. Prevent it by pruning plants annually to remove excess growth and improve air circulation. ","Typically eaten after they are processed, goji berries are frequently dehydrated to form raisin-like dried fruit or juiced. Goji berries are labor-intensive to harvest. Each small berry must be carefully plucked from arching, thorny stems and gently placed in a container. Bruised berries turn black, making careful harvest essential. ","Goji berries are most reliably propagated from cuttings or by digging up and transplanting suckers. Plants can also be started from seed harvested from the fruit, but the resulting plants will likely have varied characteristics. For example, seed propagated plants might have an exceptionally vigorous growth habit or limited fruiting or produce inferior fruit.","‘Crimson Star’ is a popular variety thanks to its vigor.

You don't want the vines to compete for water and nutrients. The root system of a grapevine can grow deep, so well-cultivated soil is best. Young grapes require an inch of water weekly during their first two years. If rainfall doesn't supply this amount, water the plants.","The best temperature for growing grapes is 77ºF to 90ºF. Any temperature below 77ºF will limit the growth of the fruit. Grapes prefer average humidity. Very high and very low humidity are not good for grape plant growth and fruit production.","For the first two or three years, apply a nitrogen fertilizer in early spring, following product label instructions for the amount to use. You may not have to do this as the vines mature, but it all depends on your observation. If the vines look vigorous and healthy, you don't need any fertilizer.","You can also apply compost around the base of the vines for the first two to three years each spring. Don't use mulch, though; it keeps the heat- and sun-loving plant too cool.","Grape vines produce fruit on one-year-old canes. Two-year and older wood is not fruitful. So annual pruning is required to produce maximum yields of high-quality fruit. If a vine is left unpruned, it will produce many more grape clusters than it can ripen. The entire plant weakens under the strain of ripening the fruit.","The best time to prune grape vines is late winter or early spring, while they are leafless. There are many different ways to prune grapes. Remember, fruit is produced on the current season's growth, which originates from last season's wood.","Pruning and training grapes may sound complicated, but it doesn't have to be. In early spring before the first growth, remove canes that produced fruit the previous year. Keep a few strong stems, and train them on wires or a trellis. Shorten them to fit the space if needed, and prune everything else off. The amount you must cut may shock you, but your grapes will grow better. You'll see buds on the remaining growth, and each bud will produce several shoots that grow leaves and flowers.","Fungi that can reduce the quality of grapes or cause fungus to develop include downy mildew, powdery mildew, grey mold, black rot, and anthracnose. Crown gall is caused by a bacterium and can kill grape vines.","If pests are eating your grapes, cover the grapes with fine mesh netting. The mesh reduces the need for chemicals and should be fine enough to keep flies, moths, beetles, and other insects from snacking on them.","Propagate grapes through dormant stem cuttings. Prepare a garden bed with well-draining soil. After the vine goes dormant in fall, select 12- to 18-inch cuttings from one-year-old growth. The cuttings should be long and straight and about the thickness of a pencil. The cuttings must be right side up or they won't root, so cutting the base of the cuttings straight across and the tops at an angle will help you identify which side is up.","Immediately, dip the bottoms of the cuttings in rooting hormone before placing them in the prepared soil. Ideally, position three buds underground and one bud above ground. Firm the soil around the cutting and keep it moist, not wet, for the rest of the winter. Growth won't start until the following spring. When it does, watch closely and plant the cuttings in their permanent location before the buds begin to swell.","Not all cuttings will root, so prepare at least 10 percent more cuttings than the quantity of vines you need.","Excellent varieties for table grapes include 'Mars', 'Reliance', Jupiter', 'Marquis', and 'Vanessa'. To make jams and jellies, grow 'Buffalo', 'Price', 'Fredonia', 'Niagara', 'Concord', and 'Catawba'.

In the hottest temperatures of the warmest climates, your American holly foliage may droop but recover. English holly (which is hardy in Zones 6-9) is slightly less tolerant of extreme hot and cold temperatures. Deep, prolonged frosts may damage or kill the plants, and extreme heat without shelter may cause the leaves to droop and scorch.","Fertilize in spring and fall with a fertilizer designed for evergreen or acid-loving plants to keep your holly plants at their best. For the amount to use, consult the product label directions.","Holly shrubs don't typically require pruning unless they become unwieldy or you want to create a hedge or geometric shape. Late spring is a good time to tackle this task. On the question of whether or not (and when) to prune, the holly family is so diverse that it's impossible to give one answer that will work for all varieties. In general, wait until dormancy for most hollies.","Pruning in late fall or early winter means you can use the clippings in holiday arrangements or wreaths. On the other hand, if you prune in late winter, you can enjoy seeing the berries outside when most plants are bare. There is no single right answer. Just don't prune in late summer or the plant might put out new growth that will die when frosts arrive.","Holly plants are mostly deer-resistant, but you may have to keep an eye out for aphids, leafminers, spider mites, whitefly, and scale.","Holly plants are also prone to issues with fungal rot, tar spot, and cankers. Many of these problems can be prevented by avoiding overwatering, removing debris from the base of the plant, pruning away overcrowded growth, and making sure your plant has good air circulation.","The best way to propagate holly is via hardwood cuttings that are taken in late spring or early summer. Holly seeds are typically too low in viability to be a reliable source for propagation.","Wearing gloves, select a 4-to-6-inch branch with both soft, immature leaves at the tip and sturdy mature leaves at the base. Cut it just below a bud union with sharp pruning shears. Use your shears to remove all of the mature leaves and some of the bark from the base of the cutting. Dip the cut end of the prepared cutting in a rooting hormone powder and poke the cutting into a grow pot prepared with a moist rooting medium. Secure the stem by tamping the soil down. Wrap your grow pot in a plastic bag and place your cutting in a sheltered area that receives dappled sunshine and keep it at an ambient temperature of 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Mist the foliage daily and keep the soil evenly moist, but not saturated. It will likely take 2 to 3 months for your cutting to take root, but once it does, you can remove the plastic bag. Keep it in a spot with bright, indirect light to continue growing. In the following spring (or when the soil temperatures are consistently above 50 degrees), you can transplant your sapling to a spot in your garden.","The diverse holly family includes trees and shrubs that come in a variety of forms: columnar, pyramidal, rounded, or weeping. Their foliage varies, too, ranging from large, spiny leaves to smooth, small leaves that resemble boxwood. Even holly's berries come in a variety of hues that include red, pink, blue, orange, yellow, and white."

Ideally, seek a spot with well-drained soil, though hollyhock will also take root in clay. pH isn't a major consideration, as these towering flowers will grow in acidic, neutral, or alkaline soil. Make sure to avoid wet winter soil.","When you first plant a hollyhock, keep it well-watered to allow the roots to take hold, then continue to water it regularly throughout the growing season. Using a soaker hose, direct the water at the base of the plant to avoid splashing the leaves; wet leaves can lead to rust, the most common plant disease in hollyhocks.","Daytime temperatures of 70℉ or warmer and nighttime temperatures of at least 60 to 65℉ are optimal for growing. In very hot, humid conditions, hollyhock is more likely to develop rust, and the disease tends to worsen as the summer goes by. These upright flowers also look their best early in the summer, before they've been worn out by the elements.","When you first plant hollyhock, adding a slow-release fertilizer to the soil can help it thrive. Once the plant is mature, you shouldn't need to continue fertilizing (although it's okay to do so).","Throughout the growing season, remove any dead or dying foliage, especially any leaves infected with rust. Once the flowers are past their prime, you can cut the hollyhock spikes to the ground."

Working organic matter into heavy soil will improve growth. Hops grow best with a regular deep soaking; an inch of rain per week is a good rule of thumb. Avoid splashing water around the plant because this could spread soil-borne diseases. Mulching helps retain moisture in the soil and inhibits weeds that compete for water and nutrients.","Fertilize hop plants when growth begins in spring (usually April) and two more times at 4 to 6 week intervals. A cup of a balanced fertilizer per hill is usually sufficient for each feeding. Don't let the fertilizer touch the plant stems. For organic hops, an addition of blood meal is helpful for supplying nitrogen. Compost can be added at any time, and is helpful in supplying micronutrients.","The most problematic diseases of hops are downy and powdery mildews. The best way to avoid them is to select varieties that are resistant and to provide good air circulation between plants by spacing them at least 3 feet apart—further apart is even better. At the end of each season, be sure to cut down all vines and remove the debris from the area.","Hops may also be challenged by pests, most commonly: spider mites, aphids, leaf hoppers, and Japanese beetles. There are a number of sprays that can be used, but it is very difficult to reach the tops of these towering plants without special equipment.","An excellent resource for disease and pest identification and suggestions for control is The Field Guide for Integrated Pest Management in Hops.","Hops are easy to propagate by taking cuttings of their rhizomes in early spring. These rhizomes should be planted immediately, either in the ground or in pots for transplanting later.","Hops varieties are generally classified as bittering (high in alpha acids) or aroma; some are considered dual-purpose and can be used both for bittering and flavor.

They can stand up to drought but not for too long.","Pruning your plants, or cutting away dead or overgrown plant matter, is necessary in order to keep your plant alive—and pruning hostas is no different. Simply cut off all the yellow, damaged, or dead leaves. Make sure to remove these leaves at their root or the point where they start to emerge from the main plant. Be sure to throw away all unwanted scraps to decrease the likelihood of disease development.","Although hostas are typically not disease-prone, the downside to these versatile perennials is that they are preyed on by several pests. Deer and rabbits love to make a meal out of tender hosta plants. If you have a particularly special plant, cage it early in the spring so its new growth doesn't become a salad snack for these critters.","Slugs and snails also can leave your hostas in tatters, so keep an eye out for any holes in the leaves, then seek out and destroy the slimy culprits. Hostas are prone to a few less noticeable fiends along with visible pests. Foliar nematodes have become a problem for hostas. Most common in the summer, these microscopic worms eat through leaf veins, which causes the foliage to yellow and eventually brown. Unfortunately, there is no known fix for foliar nematodes, and infected plants should be tossed to prevent spreading.","Another newer problem is Hosta Virus X. This tricky virus causes a mottling of the foliage that sometimes almost looks ornamental. In fact, before Hosta X was identified correctly, some varieties were introduced into the plant trade as having novel foliage, which was actually due to the virus. Send samples to your local extension office for testing if you see mottled leaves. If positive, discard the infected plants to prevent the virus from spreading to other hostas.","Because these plants are such quick growers, they can easily be divided and shared with friends. You'll know your hostas need to be divided when they get too crowded and the center of a clump starts to die out. As a general rule, count on dividing the plants every three to four years to keep them at their healthiest. Some slow-growing varieties may need more time before they're ready for division. You may be able to divide fast-growing varieties every two or three years.","The best time for dividing hostas is in the spring when the foliage emerges, so you have a better idea of where to cut. However, because hostas are pretty tough plants, you can successfully divide them in any season (except winter when the ground is frozen). Just give them plenty of water if you divide in the summer heat. Hostas can also be grown from seed.","Hosta was once just a plain green leafy plant but has evolved, and now comes in a rich palette of colors. With well over 3,000 different ones to choose from, you're bound to find at least a few hosta varieties that appeal to you.

A single application early in the spring is usually sufficient. Another application during a prolific blooming period may be helpful, but don't overfertilize. It makes the plants susceptible to disease.","Perennial lantanas need to be pruned back hard in early spring. Cut them back to within 6 to 12 inches of the ground. During summer, lightly prune the tips of the plant to encourage reblooming.","Lace bugs, aphids, and caterpillars can cause lantana leaf damage. If the plants are very dry, watch for mites. When lantanas are planted in areas that are too moist, powdery mildew and root rot are more likely to occur.","Older varieties of lantana can be started from seed. Six to eight weeks before you plan to set out seedlings, soak the seeds for 24 hours in warm water. Fill pots with soilless seed starting medium and moisten it. Put one or two seeds in each pot and cover them with 1/8 inch of the medium. Keep the pots in a warm location and cover them with clear plastic bags to maintain moisture. It may take as long as a month for the seeds to germinate. When they do, remove the plastic bags immediately.","Many new varieties of lantana are hybrids. These can be propagated by stem cuttings from young growth that hasn't become woody. In the spring, take 4-inch cuttings from the tips of the stems. Remove any leaves from the bottom half of the cutting. Fill a small pot with seed starting mix and make a hole that is 2 inches deep. Dip the bottom half of the cutting in rooting hormone and put it in the hole, firming the mix so that the cutting stands up straight. Position several small wooden sticks about the edge of the pot and position a clear plastic bag over the cutting and the sticks (which prevent the plastic bag from touching the cutting). When you see new growth, the cutting has begun rooting. Remove the plastic bag and put the pot in a warm room with a sunny window until planting time.","Lantana can be divided in the spring or early fall. Dig the plant and entire root ball out of the ground and cut it into thirds or quarters with a sharp shovel. Plant the transplants in a sunny area with soil that has been enriched with compost or manure. Place it at the same depth as the original plant.

Compacted soils can be improved by applying compost prior to planting. Watering should be even throughout the growing season but allowed to drain and dry thoroughly between applications to avoid waterlogging the soil, which can lead to root rot and other issues. Once pods begin to turn brown, stop watering so that plants can begin to die back and dry out prior to harvest. ","Lentils grow well in cool weather and begin to suffer in higher temperatures. Likewise, lentils prefer lower humidity levels, and stagnant, humid air can cause outbreaks of various types of fungal infections.","Heavy applications of fertilizer are not necessary for these legumes and inoculated lentil plants will survive in even nutrient-poor soils. However, yields can suffer in poor soils. Adding a light dose of nitrogen fertilizer can be helpful in this case.","Lentil seedlings can be pruned along the central lead to encourage bushier plants, but this is not necessary and can lead to excessive growth that blocks airflow and increases the risk of fungal infections. ","Lentils are exceptionally hardy but can be prone to fungal infections from high humidity, root rot from excessive watering, and insect pests such as aphids. ","Fungal infections can be treated by thinning plants to increase airflow and by applying organic fungicides such as neem oil and copper spray. Treat insect pests with insecticidal soap. ","Lentils can be harvested when the pods at the base of the plant begin to turn brown. Stop watering plants and allow them to dry further. When plants have begun to wither, they can be harvested by grabbing the base of the plant and pulling directly from the soil as a whole. Care should be taken not to break apart pods and lose the seeds inside. ","After harvesting plants, place them on a table or upside down in a bucket. Place drying plants in the sun or a well-ventilated room for about one week until plants have fully dried. Harvest pods and seeds from plants by plucking them by hand and splitting them open over the bucket, or thrashing the plants inside a bucket. Separate out the leaves and other debris from the lentil seeds by shaking the bucket until the lighter stems and leaves to move to the top, where they can be removed. ","Lentils are annual plants grown from seed. Harvested lentils can be saved and stored in a cool, dry location for planting the following season.

It thrives best in the temperate climates of zones 3 through 9 but needs the cold stratification period of winter to prepare its seeds for spring germination.","A native plant of the prairies, open woods, and canyons, butterfly weed also has no difficulty growing in arid climates and areas with high humidity.","Fertilization is not necessary for butterfly weed plants and often causes the plant to grow leggy instead of encouraging it to produce blooms.","When the plant dies back for winter, cut the stalks down to within a couple of inches of the ground. You don't have to do this, but it will curtail some of the plant's self-seeding tendencies. During the growing season, you can also deadhead spent blooms to encourage additional flowers."

Fully saturate the soil with water and make sure it drains from the pot. Empty excess water from the saucer or add water where the pot can drain freely (like a patio, shower, or sink). Let the soil dry between waterings to avoid root rot. Use a soil mix that drains well.","Like most houseplants, monsteras prefer a range between 65-85°F. Don’t let your home’s temperature dip below 60°F. The cold shock will cause your monstera to stop growing. ","Typically, your home’s normal humidity will work. If your home tends to err on the dry side, think about investing in a humidifier. To best cater to the plants needs, try to mist your monstera once a week. This will help mimic the tropical environment it prefers.","For this quick-growing plant, fertilizer is a must. Aim to fertilize your monstera once a month during the growing season (spring and summer). For easy application, use a 20-20-20 liquid all purpose fertilizer.","Monsteras are fast growers, gaining 1-2 feet a year. With all that growth, it’s important to remember to prune the plant. Make sure to cut back any yellowing leaves or dying stems to promote the overall health of the plant.","Monsteras typically need to be repotted every 2-3 years to support healthy growth. Some telltale signs that your monstera is ready for a larger pot include: roots coming out of drainage holes, slow/no growth, soil dries out quicker, or has many dying leaves. The best pot size for your plant can vary based on the size and speed of growth. Make sure to gradually increase the pot size. If there’s too much additional soil, your monstera will be more susceptible to root rot. Try to select an unglazed clay or terracotta pot to keep the soil dry, but the roots well hydrated. ","It’s easy to damage or break off parts of your monstera during the repotting process, so make sure to support the long stems and broad leaves while working with the plant. Implement a moss pole to stabilize the plant. This gives your plant something to stabilize itself on. This also benefits the aerial roots when they begin climbing. ","it's super easy to propagate monsteras! The easiest method is to take a stem cutting. Start by choosing a healthy stem with a few leaves. To take the cutting, snip below the leaf node (the point where leaves join the main stem). Then place the cutting into a glass of water and wait for a root system to grow. This should take 2-3 weeks. Remember to change the water every 3-5 days. Otherwise, the cutting could start to rot. ","You can also propagate your monstera by dividing the plant, or separating a part from the parent plant. The best time to implement this method is when you're repotting your plant. This gives you a full view of the root system. Select which part of the plant you want to remove and carefully separate that section, roots and all, from the rest of the plant. Then repot both plants.","Additionally, you can try air layering your plant. You'll need plastic wrap, twine or twist tie, and sphagnum moss. Cut a square of plastic wrap large enough to hold a clump of moss around a section of stem. Then, soak the moss and squeeze out excess water. Select the stem and node you want to propagate and place the moss around the area. Wrap the plastic square around the moss and tie shut. When roots form in the sphagnum moss, cut the stem below the roots and repot.","Typically, a monstera is an easy-to-maintain plant that’s usually pest free. The most common issues are yellowing leaves or curling leaves, which are related to watering. The leaves will curl from a lack of proper water and will yellow when overwatered. ","Part of having a monstera is getting those gorgeous splits in the broad leaves. If your monstera lacks these splits, it’s most likely because your plant hasn’t matured enough. The leaves will split when the plant is 2-3 years old. If your monstera is old enough, consider providing your plant with more light, either from a window or a grow lamp."

Otherwise, their large, heart-shaped leaves tend to wilt during the heat of the day.","Morning glories will grow whether it's warm or cold. They can even live through early frost and continue to flower. Grow morning glories as annuals in colder locations where temperatures approach freezing in the winter and as a perennial in warmer tropical or subtropical climates. They thrive in both arid and humid environments.","Use a low-nitrogen fertilizer every month during the growing period to fertilize morning glories. For more flowers, use a high-phosphorous product.","Morning glories don't usually require pruning except in fall after frost has killed the foliage. But if the plants start to grow larger than you want and begin to get out of hand, you can prune them back during the growing season without harm.","Wildlife love to eat morning glory flowers. Deer, groundhogs, rabbits, and other critters will chew on the lower blooms of morning glory vines, causing damage to the plants. The best way to prevent them from eating your vines is to build a 5-foot high fence around the plants. Morning glory is also susceptible to fungal diseases like leaf spot and white blister.","If you live in an area with short summers, it's helpful to plant morning glory seeds six to eight weeks before your last expected frost date in spring to help give them a head start on the season.

Moss roses keep blooming all season long with no additional care needed. However, the plants produce large amounts of seed, so you may see volunteers coming back each year if you plant them once. Fortunately, it's easy to weed out any unwanted seedlings.","Deer aren't usually attracted to moss rose plants, but aphids and slugs are sometimes a problem. The biggest problem—stem and root rot—occurs when the plant receives too much water or is in soil that drains poorly.","The easiest way to propagate moss rose plants is to take cuttings from the plants before that first frost in the fall. Remove the leaves from the bottom third of the cuttings and plant them in a sterile planting medium. Put them in a warm place indoors.","You can also grow moss rose from seeds after the weather warms above 70°F. Sow them in well-draining soil and keep them moist for about 10 days.

A slightly acidic pH is preferable. Soil that drains quickly reduces the likelihood of root rot.","Expect your New Guinea impatiens to need lots of water. Their leaves easily lose moisture, and this tendency is exacerbated in low-humidity conditions. They are not drought-tolerant and will often wilt when it's hot outside if they don't receive plenty of water. If they start to wilt, give them a thorough watering and they should bounce back in a few hours. However, the re-hydrated plant may still show signs of stress, including a reduction in blossoms and burnt foliage, especially if wilting occurs repeatedly.","Try not to let the plants dry out between waterings. (Hint: Plant New Guinea impatiens alongside other plants with similar growing requirements.) For established plants, a weekly soaking should be sufficient; newly planted New Guinea impatiens need more water than mature plants.","Overwatering can lead to root rot, so don't let the soil become soggy. To help prevent fungal disease, aim the water at the base of the plant, avoiding the foliage and flowers, and cut back on watering when the temperatures are cooler.","Since New Guinea impatiens don't respond well to cool nighttime temperatures (below 45℉), it's best to plant them about 2 weeks after the last spring frost. The sweet spot for growing them is when daytime temperatures hover between 70 and 85℉ and nighttime temperatures fall between 55 and 65℉. They will stop producing new buds when nighttime temps are 70℉ and higher. New Guineas perform well in high humidity, which reduces water loss through the leaves.","New Guinea impatiens don't require heavy fertilizing. When you plant them in a flowerbed, simply add a slow-release fertilizer to the soil, and you shouldn't need to fertilize again. Container garden plants will benefit from a biweekly application of water-soluble fertilizer.","While the plant is immature, pinching the tips of branches can help direct growth into a more attractive shape. Leggy impatiens can also be trimmed back to a leaf node, though you shouldn't remove more than 6 inches at a time.","Although New Guinea impatiens naturally drop their flowers, deadheading throughout the season will encourage blooming into the fall. This clean-up will also help you avoid the growth of Botrytis fungal mold, which can form on the dead flowers. When removing spent blossoms, simply pinch the stem back, right above the first leaf pair. If your impatiens are potted, shaking the container may also encourage old blossoms to fall off."

In very humid environments, however, it is likely to suffer from fungal issues that stem from a lack of air circulation in the dense foliage.","Fertilizer is not required with pachysandra, but you can apply a balanced fertilizer in late winter or early spring (before new growth arrives) if you fear your soil will not provide the nutrients needed for lush growth. Just be sure to avoid fertilizers that are overly rich in phosphorus as they may cause your pachysandra to focus on flowering instead of producing new foliage.","Pruning pachysandra is not necessary, but pinching back the plants occasionally in the first few years can encourage a bushier growth habit. You can also thin out the tips of your plant in the spring if they become leggy or to encourage air circulation (which will also lead to more dense growth). If you wish to do so, use sharp pruning shears to cut the plants back by half.","If you have a bed of well-established pachysandra plants, you can also trim them with a lawnmower set high enough to avoid damaging the crown of the plant (about 4 inches). Just be sure that your mower blades are sharp.","One of the most common problems for pachysandra is leaf blight. This fungus appears first as spotting on leaves and spreads via splashing water, so it's best to avoid overhead watering when this fungus is present. In severe cases, fungicides may be needed or, ultimately, the removal of contaminated plants. While this will generally not kill your pachysandra, it can weaken them.","Another pest you may find on your pachysandra is euonymus scale. This narrow, white, or gray insect covers the leaves. The scale harms pachysandra by latching on and creating a waxy covering over itself as it feeds off the plant's juices. Because of the hard waxy covering, scale pests are extremely hard to control. In cases of large infestations, manual removal may be necessary as well as an insecticidal drench.","Pachysandra spreads via underground rhizomes or stolons, which makes it easy to propagate through cuttings or division.","If you would like to divide your pachysandra, water it well in the spring, approximately 24 hours before you plan to dig it up. When you are ready, dig down about 10 to 12 inches to isolate a 1-foot section of plants. Lift the clump and separate it with a sharp trowel or knife. Make sure each section has viable roots and shoots and replant them immediately (approximately 12 inches apart). Water your divided plants thoroughly and continue to maintain consistently moist (but not wet) soil for the first 2 months after division.","You can also take a cutting in the spring by selecting a 3 to 6-inch piece from a healthy stem and snipping it off below the leaves with sharp shears. Select a stem with leafy growth and avoid clipping stems with active buds or flowers. Dip the cut edge of the stem in rooting hormone and insert it into a prepared pot filled with a moist mix of 3 parts compost and 1 part perlite. Set your cutting in a bright, but sheltered location and maintain consistently moist (but not wet) compost until the cutting takes root.

To create a nutrient-rich environment, amend the soil with organic matter—manure, compost, or peat moss—or add a 5-10-5 fertilizer to the soil before planting. Consider testing your soil each year to make sure the pH and nutrient levels are in the right range for growth.","As cool-season plants, pansies perform best when soil temperatures are between 45℉ and 65℉. Make sure to plant them in a new location every other year to avoid a buildup of Pythium, a fungus that can cause root rot, in the soil. Never plant them in the same spot for more than three years.","To keep the soil sufficiently moist, give pansies a thorough drink—about an inch of water—once a week after planting. Once they're well-established in the fall and winter, you can switch to watering only when they're dry or before you apply fertilizer. In the spring, conditions may be wet enough that you don't need to water them regularly.","Avoid watering in the late afternoon or evening, and don't water from overhead or directly onto the leaves—these practices can increase the risk of disease. Focus instead on soaking the base of the plant.","Pansies peak when temperatures are mild—about 40℉ at night and 60℉ during the day. Anticipate the most blossoms in the cooler months of spring and fall. In warmer regions, blooming may continue into the winter. The flowers will fade during the hot months of summer, and the plants don't tolerate humidity.","While pansies can withstand frost, they will become stressed after repeated freeze-thaw cycles. You can protect them when the temperature plummets by placing pine boughs, straw mulch, or white landscaping fabric on the ground around them.","Adding a granular, slow-release 5-10-5 fertilizer to the soil before you plant your pansies can help create a nutrient-rich environment for growth. (You can also use manure to condition the soil.) Avoid formulations with high levels of nitrogen, as this can lead to soft leaves and predispose your plants to rot.","After watering your pansies, apply the fertilizer again in the late fall and early spring, around March. If you apply it every four to five weeks throughout spring, your pansies will have plenty of nutrients to fuel their growth and flowering. Typically, you'll need about 1 pound of granular fertilizer per 50 square feet of pansies. Liquid fertilizer is also acceptable.","Pansies respond well to regular deadheading. Every couple of days, if you can, pinch off faded blooms and any fruit (small green seed capsules) that may be forming. This will spur plants to continue blooming. You may also cut pansies back by a third to stimulate new growth and prolong blooming.","Heat causes pansies to become leggy and stop blooming. When summer warmth begins to take its toll, go ahead and dig up your pansies to make way for summer annuals."

In all other climates, it is usually grown as an annual because it does not overwinter well indoors. The plant thrives in high humidity.","Papyrus typically doesn't require fertilizing but if you grow papyrus in a container by itself or a similarly closed ecosystem, it will benefit from a fertilizer for water gardens or aquatic plants.","Other than for aesthetic reasons, papyrus does not require pruning.

Outdoors, parlor palms are hardy in Zones 10 to 12; they grow easily in rich, moist, well-drained soil and partial shade. If your outdoor soil lacks nutrients, enrich it with well-decomposed compost prior to planting.","Parlor palms like moist (but not wet) soil and are drought-tolerant once established. When the soil of your potted plant feels dry down to your second knuckle, water your palm thoroughly until the excess escapes through pot's drainage hole. These palms don't like sitting in wet soil, so be sure to dump any water-filled saucers. Outdoor parlor palms should be watered regularly when planted in well-drained soil but be careful of overwatering. They will not tolerate sitting in waterlogged soil.","Most palms need temperatures above 40 degrees Fahrenheit to thrive and parlor palms are no exception. They are happiest when temperatures are between 65 and 80 degrees, but can tolerate short cold or hot bouts. If the weather is fair and warm, indoor parlor palms can be moved outdoors in the summer. Just be sure to protect them from direct sun, which will scorch their leaves. Choose a shaded outdoor location and water daily in hot, dry conditions. Move your plant back indoors when night temperatures fall below 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Freezing conditions are likely to cause irreparable damage or death.","Whether grown indoors or outdoors, parlor palms enjoy a warm, humid environment that mimics the climate of a tropical forest. If your humidity levels indoors are below 40%, consider misting the plant 3 to 4 times per week or setting the pot on a tray of wet pebbles to increase the environmental humidity.","You can encourage lush growth by feeding your palm with an all-purpose liquid fertilizer or fish emulsion every two weeks, according to product label instructions, but only in spring and summer.","Parlor palms are slow-growing plants and aren’t likely to need pruning at all. In fact, too much pruning may kill the plant. Trim away dead or diseased fronds but avoid cutting the plant from the top."

However, it does best in a moderate climate of 50ºF to 70ºF. To protect parsley in colder climates, add mulch to outdoor plants.","Use a 5-10-5 commercial fertilizer to feed parsley planted outdoors in the ground one or two times each season. Fertilize indoor parsley plants in containers every six weeks. Use a liquid vegetable fertilizer at half-strength.","When parsley plants develop several sets of leaves, thin them (pull or snip out the extras with scissors) so they stand 3 to 4 inches apart. Parsley is a biennial plant, not a perennial, meaning it grows the first year, then sends up a tough stalk with flowers that turn into seeds and die.

Mulching around the base helps to conserve soil moisture.","Passionflowers won’t survive the winter below Zone 6 so you can either overwinter them indoors or grow them as an annual. Even if you are within the plant’s zone range, it is a good idea to protect the plant from desiccating winter winds, which can damage stems and leaves, by planting it in a protected spot. Passionflower does best in moderate to high relative humidity above 60 percent.","Fertilize passionflower once at the beginning of the growing season in the spring with a balanced completed fertilizer, following product label directions, and keep the plant on a fertilization schedule every four to six weeks until the late summer.","Passionflower blooms on new growth so if you want to cut the plant back to keep it in shape, prune it before the new growth begins in the spring. If you are bringing your passionflowers indoors for the winter, trim them back to the size that fits your space requirements.

They are prone to rot in soggy or wet soil conditions but, oddly enough, can be grown in water alone. If you want to grow your peace lily in water, the crown of the plant should sit above the waterline to prevent rot.","Peace lilies would rather be under-watered than overwatered. The amount of water your plants will need depends on the size of your container and the drainage capabilities of the soil. As a general guideline, water only when the top inch of the soil is dry and let your plants dry out a bit between waterings.","Peace lilies are tropical plants that prefer a warm, humid climate—ideally with a temperature between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit and a humidity level of 50% or higher. Temperatures below 40 degrees will damage the plant. To increase humidity levels for your peace lily, wipe the leaves down with a damp cloth or mist the foliage regularly with distilled water.","Peace lilies do fine with the occasional dose of a slow-release fertilizer but don’t overdo it. Limit feedings to every 6 weeks throughout the spring and summer and watch for yellowing or browning in the leaves. Over-fertilization makes peace lilies prone to leaf burn.","If you are growing a peace lily in water alone, add some liquid fertilizer to the water every 4 to 6 weeks to make up for the loss of soil nutrients.  ","Peace lilies benefit from regular pruning and deadheading (every six months or as needed). After a stalk has produced a “flower”, it will not produce another one and will eventually turn brown and die. Cut back spent stalks at the base of the plant to make room for new stalks.

It is often dark brown or black in color, indicating it has plenty of organic matter. The pH should be between 6.5 and 7. If the soil in your selected planting site doesn't measure up, amend it before planting, or select a different site. ","Newly planted trees need to be watered regularly so the soil is constantly moist. Water slowly but deeply to soak the soil about 18 inches deep. Water established trees every 7 to 14 days if there is no rain.","Peach trees have specific requirements both for cold and hot temperatures. To break dormancy in the spring and produce fruit, they need a certain number of hours with temperatures between 32 and 45 degrees F (chill hours). If you grow a peach tree in a container, leave it outside in the winter but move it to a sheltered location and wrap the container in burlap or bubble wrap to protect the roots from the cold. You can also place the container in a larger container and fill the space with mulch for insulation.","At the other end of the temperature spectrum, peach trees need warm, sunny summer weather but not extreme heat. Most peaches grow in zone 5 to 8 but there are also more cold-hardy varieties that can be grown in zone 4, as well as heat-tolerant varieties that grow in zone 9 or 10.","Humid conditions foster the spread of fungal diseases.","A specially formulated complete fruit tree fertilizer that is high in nitrogen is best for peach trees. Apply it, following product label directions, once in the spring around the time of the bloom, a second time in May, and a third time after the harvest but not later than August 15. Late fertilization prompts the tree to produce lots of new growth, which is susceptible to frost damage.","Pruning takes a bit of time in late winter but pays great dividends with increased fruit production in summer. Peach trees are most productive when pruned annually. Prune peach trees in late winter. Trim away any damaged or rubbing branches. Prune branches back to an outward-facing bud to stimulate new growth. Prune back exceedingly fast-growing shoots and branches that lend the tree an odd shape. Each year, cut out a portion of the older fruiting wood to rejuvenate the tree.","Peach trees have a tendency to produce more fruit than can ripen during the season. Much of this fruit is naturally thinned, or shed, by the tree. This natural thinning doesn't always happen, which stresses the tree and decreases production due to the large fruit load. Home gardeners can easily thin peach trees by hand. About 20 to 40 days after full bloom, thin peaches so the remaining fruit is spaced 6 to 8 inches apart on each branch."

Don't let the soil dry out completely—keep it slightly moist—but don't overwater.","Peanuts grow best in high heat and high humidity. The soil must reach 65°F-70°F for germination. After that, the plants grow best in a range of 85°F-95°F. When nighttime temperatures fall for several days, the soil temperature might drop to 65°F or lower, at which point the peanuts stop maturing.","Some gardeners think that peanut plants don't need any fertilizer because they fix nitrogen in the soil, but these plants can benefit from an application of bone meal or a granular fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 0-10-20 in the quantity recommended on the packaging. Add the fertilizer to the soil before the seeds are sown. Peanut plants are susceptible to fertilizer burn, so don't over fertilize.","When the flowers start to form on the peanut plants, add gypsum to the soil at a rate of 1/2 cup per 10 feet of plants.

Long summers are necessary for good nut production.","Fertilizers can be beneficial for younger trees, but usually aren't necessary for mature pecans. Tree fertilizer stakes can be set around the canopy drip line in early spring.","Young pecan trees don't usually need pruning because they'll naturally develop a full canopy as they grow. On grafted trees, remove watersprouts and any other growth from under the graft union to keep the grafted part of the tree strong. As trees begin to gain height, lower branches can be pruned if you want to raise the height of the canopy. ","Pecans are prone to developing scab, aphids, and webworms (a type of caterpillar), but these pests are rarely fatal. Scab-resistant cultivars are available and should be chosen in regions with higher humidity where scab, a type of fungus, spreads easily.","Pecan nuts (seeds) can be planted in the fall for winter stratification and spring growth, but genetic variation among seedlings and slow growth can be restrictive. Propagation of known cultivars grafted onto select rootstocks is the best way to avoid issues with cross-pollination and ensure resistance to disease.","Harvesting pecan nuts is exceptionally easy and amounts to just waiting until the nuts begin to drop from the tree. Because pecan trees become very large over time, shaking the tree and branches is not feasible for most homeowners.","After pecans have begun to fall, harvest daily to avoid predation by wildlife and inspect all fallen nuts for signs of insect damage like holes or cracks in the shells. Newly dropped pecans will look brighter and cleaner than older, duller nuts from previous seasons that might still be on the soil surface.","Once harvested, allow nuts to "cure" in a dry location for a week to ten days prior to storing. This process will eliminate excess moisture that can lead to spoiling during storage.","Like other members of the Juglandaceae family (including walnuts, hickory, and butternuts), pecans produce a chemical known as juglone that can hinder the growth of plants under the trees’ canopies. Sedges, grasses, coral bells (Heuchera spp.), and other smaller perennials with fibrous root systems can be planted under the canopy of pecans. Larger shrubs and small trees (even those resistant to juglone) should not be planted adjacent to young pecans to avoid root competition. "

The prairie-type penstemons are more tolerant of standard garden soils, whereas the alpine varieties require excellent drainage, similar to what is found in gravel gardens and trough gardens. No matter what type of penstemon you plant, they all perform well in fairly nutrient-poor soils and tend to put out too much tender growth in rich soil.","Most penstemons are cold-hardy to about 24°F. In summer, they tolerate temperatures into the 90s. They grow in a range of humidity levels, depending on the variety.","Don't give penstemons compost or aged manure; it is too rich for the plants. Instead, apply an organic fertilizer only once a year, according to manufacturer's instructions.","To winterize the plant, cut all the foliage to about 2 inches above the soil line in late fall or early winter. During the growing season, remove individual stalks that have flowered at the soil line unless you want the plant to self-seed with the copious amount of seed it produces.","Penstemon plants attract spider mites, pests that can be controlled with a strong spray of water or insecticidal soap or neem oil.","A too-damp environment can lead to botrytis leaf mold or powdery mildew. Provide good air circulation around the plants and don't water the plants from the top.","A microscopic nematode called an eelworm can inhabit the soil around the roots of the plant. Litte can be done for the plant at this point; it is best to remove and destroy it. Before planting new plants, replace the soil in the area where the infested plant grew to prevent reinfection.","Penstemon can be propagated by division, stem cuttings, and seed.","To propagate by division: Dig up a mature penstemon in early spring. Cut apart the root system, making sure that each division has a portion of the roots. Plant the divisions back in the garden and water them or plant them in containers to give away.","To increase your plants with stem cuttings: To take cuttings, cut a 5-inch section from the tip of a healthy penstemon plant just below a leaf node. Remove the leaves from the lower half of the cutting. Dip the bottom of the cutting in rooting hormone and insert it into planting medium containing sand and perlite. Cover the pot with a plastic bag that has holes poked in it to combat condensation, and keep the cutting in filtered light in a warm environment. Lift the bag daily, misting if the planting medium is dry. After three or four weeks, gently lift the cutting to see if roots have developed (they should be at least 1/2 inch). If so, repot in a slightly moist potting mixture. If not, return them to the pot and check again in a couple of weeks.","To grow from seed: If your penstemon isn't a hybrid, you can harvest seed from a mature plant approximately six weeks after it blooms. Cut a flower stalk several inches beneath a seed head and place it in a bag to dry for at least a week. After it is dry, pinch the seed head to release the seeds. Plant them outdoors in the fall, as you would with purchased seeds, for plants the following season.","New penstemon varieties are being produced constantly. In many cases, new varieties tend to be improvements of older types, with larger blooms, more compact habits, or darker foliage. There is also work to create continuous-blooming annuals.

Give them enough water to soak into the top 5 inches of soil. Continue to water your plants even after the flowers have faded so the leaves remain healthy.","Peonies are cold hardy; many types can tolerate winter temperatures as low as -40°F, which makes them excellent choices for cold areas. Herbaceous peonies need a winter dormancy period of about six weeks where the temperature stays at about 40°F, so they aren't often grown in hot areas. The plants grow best in average humidity.","To fertilize your peonies, apply compost, bone meal, or well-rotted manure in early summer as a soil amendment. You can also use a fertilizer with higher levels of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), following the directions on the product. Avoid nitrogen-heavy (N) fertilizers. These promote good foliage growth but discourage strong blooms.","After peonies have put on their show for the year, a little TLC will ensure that they come back even stronger next year. Deadheading, or removing faded flowers, helps the plant save energy for next year's blooms and prevents fungal diseases. Remove the spent blooms, but don't cut away any foliage (the plant will need those leaves to help build up flowers for next year).","For herbaceous peonies, you can cut the whole plant to the ground after a fall frost has killed off the foliage. In the spring, new growth will appear from the roots. For tree peonies, prune them in late spring. Be sure to remove any damaged wood. Make your cuts at an angle, right above outward-facing buds.","You may see lots of ants on peonies. Don't fret; they won't harm your plant! Just ignore them, and they'll eventually leave to feed elsewhere. You should inspect your plants for signs of common peony diseases, though. Here are a few to watch out for:","The easiest ways for home gardeners to propagate herbaceous peonies (the most common type in the United States) is by division or seed.","Division: In the fall, after the herbaceous peony foliage has faded, dig the entire plant up with a shovel. Remove as much of the soil from the roots as possible. With a sharp knife, cut off sections of the crown, making sure each section has roots and at least three buds. Replant the sections immediately in a prepared garden bed and water them well. Note: division doesn't work with tree peonies; gardeners usually sow seed for them.","Seed: Most peonies produce seeds that can be harvested and sown, but peonies grown from seed often don't resemble the parent plant. Prepare a garden bed that will be home to the young peonies for the first three years. Fresh seed that is harvested immediately after the plant blooms delivers the best plants the soonest. Purchased dry seed should be sown in summer. It requires longer to hydrate and break its dormancy period. Press peony seeds into the soil no more than 1/2 inch deep and 1 to 2 inches apart. Don't cover the seeds with soil. Water the bed and apply 1 inch of wood chips or wood mulch. Cover the entire bed with a sheet of clear plastic, weighted down on the edges, and leave it in place until the following early spring when the seedlings start to grow.","Peonies come in three main types: herbaceous, tree, and itoh. Herbaceous peonies (Paeonia lactiflora) are the most common in gardens, with hundreds of varieties to choose from. These varieties usually have scented flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. As the name suggests, herbaceous peonies don't form woody stems. Instead, the stems stay green and flexible, so they may need staking to keep them from flopping over, especially when the flowers get wet in the rain. These peonies produce new growth from the plant's crown in spring, which all dies back to the ground after a frost, similar to most other perennial plants. They grow between 2-3 feet tall.","As the name suggests, tree peonies grow from a trunk-like base (Paeonia suffruticosa or Paeonia lemoinei, also called deciduous peony). They are more expensive and grow slower but can eventually reach up to 5 feet tall. Tree peonies also don't need any staking because their woody stems can withstand the weight of the huge flowers. For example, 'Seidai' is a tree peony variety that produces double-flower pink blooms that can reach 8 inches in diameter.","The itoh peony, or intersectional peony (Paeonia lemoinei x Paeonia lactiflora), is a hybrid of the first two types. These types of peonies offer more unusual colors, such as orange and yellow. Some popular varieties include 'Bartzella' and 'Cora Louise'. They grow to a middle height between the garden and tree types, usually about 3 feet tall.","There is no shortage of colorful peonies to choose from. Here are just a few favorites."

In the absence of rain, in-ground petunias should be watered about once a week, more often during a heat wave. Container plants need daily watering. Petunias in hanging baskets might even need to be watered twice daily in hot summer weather.","Petunias are heat-loving plants. Hot weather is not a problem for them but they don’t handle high humidity well, so they are not the best choice for locations where summers are hot and humid.","Because petunias are such vigorous bloomers, they need a substantial amount of nutrients to keep up their blooming power. Plant them in soils rich in organic matter and fertilize them regularly throughout the growing season with a balanced complete fertilizer.","Petunias are fairly low maintenance, but many older varieties may require deadheading to keep up a constant display of blooms. Meanwhile, most new types are self-cleaning, so deadheading is unnecessary.","If they get too leggy, some petunias may also benefit from an occasional shearing back to help encourage a new flush of compact growth."

Pistachio trees produce long taproots capable of reaching water deep underground, which makes them drought tolerant and capable of going through dry periods better than many other fruit and nut trees. Standing water and high humidity can lead to root rot and fungal diseases. ","Pistachio trees should be fertilized early in the season with a 12-12-17 or similarly formulated fertilizer and then again about midsummer until trees are established. Because pistachio trees bear in alternate years, mature trees can be fertilized less during off years.","Pistachios are heavy users of nitrogen and will become chlorotic (yellowing of leaves) without a steady supply of the nutrient. Soil testing can help determine other potential nutrient deficiencies. ","As with many fruit and nut trees, pistachios should be pruned in late winter or early spring before leaves have begun to appear. Begin yearly pruning by removing any dead, broken, or crossed branches. Any branches from below the graft should always be removed as well.","Pistachios can either be grown along a central leader or by the open center method, but because of their natural growth habit, pruning them into a vase shape isn’t necessary and they grow that way over time on their own. ","Flowers and fruit are produced on one-year-old branches. Due to their year on/year off cycling, heavier pruning can be done on off years. To avoid infecting trees, always clean and disinfect pruning shears and saws prior to use.","Pistachio trees are highly susceptible to a variety of pests and diseases. Insects and fungal infections are common issues and environmental issues such as droughts, flooding, and poor soil increases the likelihood of infestation or infection.","The prevalence of diseases can be reduced by only watering around the base of the tree and by avoiding wetting the leaves and canopy of the tree. Localized humidity can be decreased by limiting the amount of nearby plants such as grasses, shrubs, and nearby trees. Good air circulation will help dry the ambient air as well.","The vast majority of pistachios are propagated by grafting. This technique attaches known varieties onto the rootstock of a variety or related species best adapted for the growing region it is to be planted. This allows for better control over the characteristics of the tree than a seed-grown tree. Pistachios can also be grown from seeds, but unlike with grafts,","By far the most common female cultivar is known as ‘Kerman’, but others exist as well. Newer female cultivars include ‘Golden Hills’, ‘Lost Hills’, and ‘Gum Drop’. Male cultivars should be selected to flower at the same time as female cultivars. Both ‘Peters’ and ‘Famoso’ are good pollinators for ‘Kerman’ while ‘Randy’ is a good pollinator for ‘Golden Hills’ and ‘Lost Hills’. For ‘Gum Drop’, use the male cultivar ‘Tejon’. "

Supplemental watering is only needed if there's an extended period of drought. Poppies planted in containers may need a bit of additional water but should be allowed to dry out between waterings.","Oriental poppies do best in cool temperatures and low humidity. Temperatures over 65ºF can inhibit their growth, which is why early spring planting is recommended. They're not tolerant of the high summer heat, so be aware that the foliage on your oriental poppy plants may wither (or disappear entirely) during the year’s hottest months. Do not be tempted to overwater your oriental poppies to combat this problem as you may end up killing the plant via root rot instead.","Oriental poppies don't need fertilizer unless there's too much nitrogen in the soil. If this is the case, feed your plants once a year (in late winter or early spring) with a phosphorous-rich fertilizer, by following the product manufacturer's instructions.","If your oriental poppy plants are too crowded, they'll become weedy. Remove seeds and seedlings regularly so established plants have the room they need to grow. Cut plants back to the ground after they flower. This will encourage healthy foliage and may allow for a second flowering later in the season if the weather is right.","Oriental poppies are largely resistant to pests but may develop botrytis blight, powdery mildew, gray mold, or root rot if they're waterlogged. Try to wash the mildew from the leaves or treat your plants with an antifungal if needed.","In shadier locations, aphids and thrips can suck the sap from oriental poppies and damage them.","The easiest way to propagate oriental poppies is to sow the seeds directly in early spring or fall. You can harvest the seeds of your oriental poppy blooms in mid to late summer. Snip the stems of your poppies a couple of inches below the seed capsule and shake the seeds into a paper bag (they will be tiny). Store the bag in a cool, dry place until you are ready to plant them in early spring.","It is possible to propagate oriental poppies via root cuttings, but you will need to handle the roots cautiously to avoid upsetting the parent plant. Dig a wide circle around the plant and gently lift the roots, shaking off the excess soil. Cut a healthy, firm root from the plant’s base (no more than 1/3 of the plant’s roots) and return the parent plant to its original location. Sprinkle the root with a rooting hormone that contains fungicide and press it into a small pot filled with a sterile rooting medium until the tip of the cutting is flush with the top of the rooting medium. Place the pot in a cool place for the winter that gets some light (like a cold frame, greenhouse, or unheated garage). Water the cutting as needed to keep the soil evenly moist, but not soggy.

That said, clay or slow-draining soil can be problematic in cool regions where prickly pear will sit in moist soil during winter.","Prickly pear cacti need very little water (which makes them excellent for xeriscaping). In fact, in many areas, they can survive on rainwater alone. Water them only when the soil is completely dry and, when you do, be careful to just moisten and not saturate the soil.","Since prickly pear cacti are used to thriving in the desert, they do best in hot climates with low levels of humidity. The fleshy pads of the cactus may shrivel or droop in the winter but don’t fret. Cacti go through cellular changes to protect themselves from frigid temperatures and the pads should plump up again as the temperature rises.","Indoor temperatures are often well-suited for container-grown prickly pear cacti if they get plenty of sunlight and are protected from drafts and temperature fluctuations.","Fertilizer is not required, but you can fertilize young prickly pear cacti with a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer. Older, more established plants can do with a 0-10-10 fertilizer if you want to encourage flowers and fruit. To improve pad production, opt for a high-nitrogen fertilizer and follow product manufacturer's directions.","You do not need to prune prickly pear cacti, but if you want to tame them, you can cut them back by removing some of the fleshy paddles. Using heavy-duty gloves and tongs, grab the pad you want to remove and slice it (carefully) with a sharp knife or machete at the base where it meets the next pad or trunk.","Older pads will be more difficult to remove as they tend to become woody over time and will eventually fuse with the trunk of the cactus.

On the other hand, twig blight or anthracnose may be more challenging to fix.","Privet can be propagated via cuttings or seed.","Cuttings: In the spring, take softwood cuttings that are 6 to 8 inches long from the tips of new-growth stems, making the cut just below a leaf node. Remove the leaves from the bottom half of the cutting and dip it in rooting hormone powder. Fill an 8-inch container with soilless mix and moisten the planting medium thoroughly. Insert the bottom of the cutting into the medium and firm the medium around it. You can fit three or four cuttings in each container.","Cover the container and cuttings with a clear plastic bag and put it in a warm location with bright, indirect light. Check the container every few days to ensure the planting mix stays moist. The cuttings should root in four to six weeks. Test them by removing the cover and carefully tugging on a leaf at the top of the cutting. If you feel resistance, the cutting has rooted. When rooting occurs, remove the plastic bag permanently. Wait until the cuttings have robust root systems and transfer each one to its own 6-inch container.","Seed: In spring, select a site in the garden with at least 6 hours of sunlight and well-draining soil. Privet needs to be spaced so the plants have plenty of room to grow—at least 2 feet apart if planted as a hedge and up to 10 feet apart if planted as a tree or specimen plant. Loosen the top 6 inches of soil and add well-rotted compost. Sow twice the number of seeds as you need for mature plants, two in each location. Press them 1 inch deep and tamp the soil over them so there is good soil/seed contact. Moisten the soil but don't overwater it.

For summer-bearing raspberries, it takes two years for each cane to produce fruit. Individual canes grow just leaves the first year, produce fruit the second year, and then die. You can cut second-year canes back to the ground after you’ve harvested all the fruit from them; each cane only produces fruit once. But, be sure to leave all the new canes that come up each year because they’ll produce berries next year. If those first-year canes (also called primocanes) are cut off or die back during winter, your raspberries will not produce fruit because you have no two-year-old canes (called floricanes) left in the patch.","In contrast, fall-bearing raspberry varieties do bear fruit in late summer/early fall on the tips of first-year canes. Those tips die off over the winter, but the rest of the cane fruits the following summer, then dies completely. Because fall-bearing raspberries will give you a second crop the following summer, you can wait to cut down the canes until the next autumn. But here’s a trick used by many raspberry growers: Instead of getting two crops from each cane, prune back all of the canes to the ground in late winter or early spring.

","Redbuds sometimes send out low branches that can be pruned either in the winter or at the appearance of new leaves (immediately following the tree’s bloom period). Reduce the length of lateral branches to keep the tree’s structure strong and allow for passage near the trunk. While you are pruning, keep an eye out for any volunteers that may have sprung up from dropped seeds and pull them to prevent them from taking root too close to other trees or plants. Diseased or damaged redbud branches can be removed at any time.","Unfortunately, redbud trees are prone to issues with fungal diseases—in particular, Botryosphaeria canker. Cankers start as small sunken areas brown-to-black areas but can grow and ultimately kill the whole tree (and neighboring trees as well). If you notice signs of a canker, use sanitized garden shears to prune off the dead or dying branches by making cuts in the healthy portions of the tree (not the canker) and sanitize the shears between each cut.

(There are select varieties of serviceberry that can tolerate clay soil.)","Acidic soil is preferable, but these trees can also handle a neutral pH. In alkaline conditions, serviceberries will become chlorotic, a condition associated with the lightening or whitening of leaves, due to a lack of chlorophyll.","During your plant's first year, water it regularly—as often as twice a week, depending on rainfall and temperature— and apply a layer of mulch around its base to help maintain moisture levels. The soil should be moist but not wet. After that, you can reduce your watering to every two weeks. You can also water only during dry spells, but keep in mind, serviceberry will yield the best berries when it's kept hydrated. Soak the base of the tree, not the leaves, to reduce the risk of disease.","Although well-established serviceberries can tolerate drought, you shouldn't plant them during dry periods. Note also that high humidity can increase the likelihood of disease.","Fertilize in the spring, as the serviceberry emerges from its dormant season and buds begin to break. Feed each tree with 4 ounces of all-purpose fertilizer (e.g. 16-16-16). If you perform a soil test and levels of phosphorous and potassium are adequate, you can use a nitrogen-only formulation instead.","Serviceberry can be treated as a large shrub with lots of branches or pruned to resemble a small tree. Some species of serviceberry can sucker and create spreading colonies. Regardless, these plants grow relatively fast. That makes pruning an important part of their care, especially when they reach maturity.","Aim to prune serviceberries when the plant is dormant to minimize the loss of sap. This can be in late fall, winter, or early spring before new growth appears. Your goal is to maintain an open canopy to promote air circulation and let light reach the lower parts of the plant.","For the first three years, limit your trimming to unhealthy or damaged branches, as well as suckers (as needed).

They thrive in areas with high humidity, but they will tolerate average humidity, too.","The best time to add fertilizer is just before planting. Because sweet potatoes are not heavy feeders, working compost into the soil at planting time usually provides sufficient nutrients. A slow-release organic fertilizer can also be added to the soil prior to planting. Do not over-fertilize, especially with nitrogen, as this will lead to excess leafy growth at the expense of production of the sweet potato roots.","Don't prune the sweet potato vines—the leaves are necessary to manufacture the food that is stored in the tuberous roots. If your vines wander further than you want them to, just lift them up and direct them to grow elsewhere.","Deer are fond of sweet potato leaves and can decimate a planting. If deer are a problem in your yard, protect the plants with fencing or netting. Few other pests cause significant problems although golden tortoise beetles, aphids, and a variety of caterpillars sometimes feed on the leaves. In some areas, wire worms and root knot nematodes can cause problems underground. ","Fusarium wilt and black scurf are fungal diseases that may infect sweet potatoes. Fusarium wilt causes leaves to turn yellow and vines to wilt. Sweet potatoes infected with black scurf develop rounded black blotches on the sweet potato. The best prevention for diseases is to plant certified disease-free slips, choose resistant varieties, and rotate your sweet potato patch each year.","Unlike the regular potato, which is a tuber (a modified stem), the sweet potato is a tuberous root. This difference is significant in how new plants are started. To plant potatoes, you simply cut a potato into pieces, each with a couple eyes, and plant it. Sweet potatoes are planted from slips, which are rooted stems that grow from the sprouting end of a sweet potato. Growing slips is not difficult, but it does take some time; you can also purchase slips either by mail order or from your local garden center.","To grow your own sweet potato slips, purchase a healthy, untreated sweet potato and set it lengthwise in a container of potting soil or sand and cover the lower half of the sweet potato with potting soil. Keep it moist and warm. Within a few weeks, shoots will begin to sprout from one end. When the shoots reach about six inches long, break them off the sweet potato and place the lower end of the slip in water where it will form roots. One sweet potato will usually produce 10 to 20 slips. If you have a long warm season, you can take stem cuttings off growing plants and place the cuttings in water to root for a second planting.","Harvest your sweet potatoes in the fall when weather begins to turn cooler and vines start with wither. Aim to harvest before your area's first frost—a light frost won’t usually damage the roots, but a hard frost may injure roots near the soil surface.","Use a garden fork to lift the sweet potatoes and brush soil from the roots. Damaged roots should be separated for immediate use. Undamaged roots can be cured for storage by placing them in a warm room (80 to 90°F) ideally with high humidity for five or six days. Curing heals small scratches and starts the conversion of starches to sugars, which improves flavor. If kept in a dark space where temperatures stay between 50 and 60°F, cured sweet potatoes can be stored for several months.","‘Beauregard’ is an old favorite with reddish skin and deep orange, moist, sweet flesh. It is a heavy producer, disease resistant, and matures in 100 days.","‘Georgia Jet’ is a good choice for gardeners in cooler regions. It tolerates cooler temperatures than most varieties and matures in about 90 days. Its flesh is bright orange and has excellent flavor.","‘Bush Porto Rico’ produces heavy yields on more compact plants, so is well suited to smaller gardens. Its flesh is reddish-orange, and it matures in 110 days.","‘O’Henry’ is a tan skinned variety with creamy-yellow, somewhat dry flesh with a delicate flavor.

The best time to divide the plant is early spring or early fall when it isn't actively blooming. Dig up a clump with a shovel and brush the soil off the roots with your hands. Pull apart the clump to make two or three new sections, each with a portion of roots and foliage. Replant the new sections immediately in moist prepared soil, spacing them 6 to 12 inches apart.","Seed: To harvest seeds from a thrift plant, leave several flowers on the plant until they dry completely. Collect them when they start to fall apart. There is no seed head; each tiny flower on the flower head produces a tiny, pale-brown seed. Rub the flower heads gently and then sift through the results to find the tiny seeds. They may still be inside the papery bracts that held them, but that is OK. They can be sown like that. Store them in a dark, cool place until needed.","In early spring, scatter the seeds in well-draining average or poor soil after the last frost, leaving the seeds exposed to sunlight.

It doesn’t tolerate heavy clay or soggy soil. Avoid planting it near areas where water stands after a big rain or places with heavy, hard soil. The best soil for growing trifoliate orange is lightweight, loose, and has a sandy texture.  Trifoliate orange generally gets all the water it needs from natural precipitation. It is somewhat drought tolerant and only requires supplement watering during periods of extreme drought. ","Hardy in Zones 5 through 9, trifoliate orange is a unique citrus plant for cold regions. In Zone 5, provide winter protection by planting it on the south side of a building or line of trees. The building or trees will protect the plant from cold, drying north winds. ","Trifoliate orange does not require fertilization. It grows, flowers, and fruits well in native soil if the soil is well-drained. ","Trifoliate orange has no notable pests or problems.","Trifoliate orange grows quickly and benefits from annual pruning. When pruning, wear heavy leather gloves to protect your hands from the sharp thorns. Prune in winter when the plant’s structure is clearly visible. Remove dead, broken, and crossing branches. Trifoliate orange spreads slowly; keep it in bounds by digging up stems that emerge beyond its allotted areas in the landscape as soon as they are noticed. ","Harvest trifoliate orange fruits in fall when they turn deep yellow and have a light citrus fragrance. The fuzzy fruit has a thick rind and is extremely sour. Dispose of fallen fruit to prevent rampant reseeding.","Make more trifoliate orange plants by taking stem cuttings and rooting them in moist potting soil. Grow the cuttings in a protected location for several weeks until a strong root system is established. After the root system is established, transplant cuttings into the landscape and water them well. Trifoliate orange can also be started from seed. Plant seeds in moist potting soil and transplant into the garden when they are 6 inches tall. ","‘Flying Dragon’ is a small cultivar compared to the species. It has a shrub-like growth habit and stands 6 feet or so tall and wide. The curling, contorted stems and dense habit make it an excellent barrier plant or hedge. ‘Flying Dragon’ has good fruit production."

Most trumpet vine doesn't need watering beyond the typical rainfall they'll get. But if you notice trumpet vine wilting, give it some water.","Once trumpet vine is established, it grows well and can even handle drought.","Trumpet vine thrives in hot and humid areas, especially in the southeastern part of the United States, where it can be very difficult to control due to its rapid growth.","Trumpet vine doesn't need any fertilizer. It grows rapidly and wildly without additional nutrients.","Trumpet vine needs consistent pruning throughout the growing season to keep it looking good and to prevent it from spreading out of control. Prune it early in spring, so it's almost to ground level, leaving just a few buds. Clean up dead leaves and branches regularly to maintain its beauty, then cut it back again in fall when it's no longer blooming and most of the dead flowers have fallen.","After trumpet vine finishes blooming, it grows large seed pods reminiscent of giant green beans that burst open and drop many seeds. Those seeds can spread trumpet vine all over your garden. Remove these pods before they fully ripen to reduce the chance of a trumpet vine takeover."

Its tolerance of dry conditions is one of the factors that make it a favorite houseplant. Don't water schefflera until the surface of the potting soil is dry. Shortly after watering, discard any water that collected in the saucer underneath the plant to prevent the soil from becoming waterlogged.","Schefflera prefers temperatures between 65 and 75 degrees during the day and needs no less than 50 degrees at night. The plant does best in relatively high humidity of 60 percent. As an outdoor plant, it is winter hardy in zones 10 to 12.","Schefflera doesn't require fertilizer for good growth. If you would like your plant to grow faster you can fertilize it with an all-purpose houseplant fertilizer in spring and summer. Be sure to follow package directions for application rates.","Sometimes schefflera grows beyond the space available. These easy-to-grow plants put on many inches of new growth in a year; it is not unusual for plants to spend the summer outside on porches or patios to produce one to two feet of new growth. When a schefflera outgrows its interior space, you can prune it back. Clip plants back any time of the year, reducing the stems by as much as two-thirds of their height.

Avoid using regular potting soil, some of which may have added fertilizers. A blend of one-third perlite (or sand) and two-thirds sphagnum peat moss provides the best drainage and moisture retention.","Keep the soil constantly moist. One way to do this is to place the flytrap pot in a saucer or tray of water about an inch deep. Never give your plants what comes out of your tap; it's usually too alkaline or might have too many minerals. Instead, rely on rainwater or use distilled water.","Venus flytrap prefers a temperature of 70°F-95°F, although some varieties can survive 40°F in the winter with protection. For the best Venus flytrap care, keep the environment humid. Good air circulation is also important when growing Venus flytrap plants, so turn on a fan in the room where you keep them.","Never add fertilizer, and don't add lime to the soil of Venus flytrap plants. These plants get the nutrients they need from their prey.","Although flytraps are carnivorous, they can go for long periods (a month or two) without eating insects. If you grow them outdoors, they'll get enough to eat naturally. If you're growing Venus flytraps indoors, you'll have to feed them small bugs such as flies and beetles periodically. When you're feeding a flytrap, don't give it any insects larger than a third of the size of the trap. Otherwise, the trap won't be able to fully close and begin digesting the food.","It doesn't matter if the bug is alive or not, but the trap needs to be triggered by movement before it will close. For dead prey, after placing the bug in an open trap, gently touch a small paintbrush to the inside of the trap until you see the trap start to close. Only trigger traps to close when there is food for the plant. Playing with the traps just to make them close wastes the plant's energy, which can lead to its decline.","When you receive a Venus flytrap, pot it in a small, deep pot using a recommended potting medium, such as one-third perlite and two-thirds peat moss. The depth of the pot encourages root growth, as does tray watering, so choose a minimum of a 4-inch-deep pot that has a drainage hole and a tray. Deeper is even better.","As for width of the pot for a Venus flytrap, the more soil around the roots, the better the insulation, so in cold areas, a wider pot is preferable. How wide? A single Venus flytrap usually grows comfortably in a 5-inch wide pot. When the plant becomes crowded—or annually, even if it doesn't become crowded—repot it using fresh potting medium.","Venus flytraps aren't bothered by many pests but might attract aphids, spider mites, or fungus gnats. If the plant has aphids, submerge it in water (distilled, not tap!) for two days. Wait a week and repeat the process. If the plant has a severe aphid infestation, apply an insecticidal soap or neem oil, which is also effective against spider mites.","In the case of fungus gnats, the larvae cause the problem. Control them by drenching the soil with Bacillus thuringiensis (BT). To prevent attracting them, keep the soil slightly moist but not soggy.","At times, the Venus flytrap leaves and traps turn black or burnt-looking, causing new owners to be alarmed. The plant is likely entering its dormant period, at which point the foliage dies only to emerge refreshed months later. However, an unhealthy Venus flytrap can display black leaves or traps due to other reasons: low humidity, letting the plant dry out too often, and root rot among them. In these cases, correct the problem and trim the black leaves and traps from the plant; they can't be saved.","You can propagate Venus flytrap by division, leaf cuttings, or seeds. Most people choose division or leaf cuttings to propagate their Venus flytraps. Propagating from seed is possible but complicated.","The best time for division is late winter to spring. Remove the plant from the container and use a sharp knife to cut it into two or more sections. Each division must contain a portion of the root system. Repot the divisions immediately in individual pots filled with a perlite/peat moss mix.","Propagate from leaf cuttings in early summer by pulling out and down to remove an entire leaf. It must have a tiny bit of rhizome at the end to be useful for propagation. Insert the leaf (or several) into a small pot filled with well-draining potting medium. Put the pot in a plastic bag to keep it from drying out. As a leaf turns black, trim it off. About six months later, a tiny but recognizable Venus flytrap will appear. If several leaves were planted in a pot, separate them at this point.","Plant breeders have been working with Venus flytraps and have come out with new varieties, including a few with large burgundy-red traps. These unusual varieties, along with familiar favorites, are available from specialty garden centers or online retailers. Popular varieties of Venus flytrap include:","Like many other plants, Venus flytraps need a period of winter dormancy when they appear to be dead (the leaves may die back) but are merely resting. Keep the plant at 35°F to 50°F during this time. Don't let terrariums freeze, or the plants may die, and the glass may break.

The plant tolerates several soil conditions, but having wet feet is not one of them. After they are established, verbena plants have average water needs—an inch of water once a week is sufficient—and can tolerate short periods of drought.","Verbena plants are cool weather stars. They flower in spring, weeks before most other flowering plants in a garden, and again in autumn when the weather cools. In the heat of the summer, they may slow down their showy display.","In general, verbenas are not fans of heat and humidity. Annual verbenas don't perform well in hot, damp summers.","An application of a fertilizer with a 3-1-2 ration, such as 16-4-8, applied in late spring and again after trimming back the plants, is usually sufficient unless they are growing in poor, sandy soil. For the amount to use, follow product label directions.","When the summer heat arrives, annual verbenas may slow down on blooming or become leggy. If this happens, trim up to one-third of the plant, but no more, to improve its appearance and encourage autumn blooms.","When growing verbenas as perennials, cut back the old stems of the plant to 2 inches before new growth starts in spring.","As far as problems go, verbenas are pretty free of disease. The biggest concern is mildew, which shows up on the plants as a powdery white residue on the leaves and eventually causes the plant to slowly decline in vigor. Generally, it will not kill a plant but will stress it some and slow it down. The best solution for powdery mildew is to plant verbena in an area with good air circulation, making sure the plant's leaves dry out well after rain or a watering. If this has been a problem in the garden in the past, clean up any old plant debris, such as dead leaves or stems on the ground. Cleaning up old material is the best prevention. Rotate placement so the same susceptible plants aren't in the same spot each year.","If you're interested in growing annual verbenas in your garden or containers, they can be started from seed. However, if the plant is a hybrid, stem cuttings are a better propagation method because they result in seedings that are identical to their parents.","When starting from seed, in spring, sprinkle seeds over rich, well-draining topsoil and don't cover them. Keep the soil moist, and the seeds will germinate in a few weeks.","Start plants from cuttings in late spring. Cut a 3-inch stem with no flower on it. Remove all but the topmost one or two sets of leaves and plant the cutting in a small pot filled with moist, well-draining planting medium. Place the pot with cutting inside a clear plastic bag.

This is particularly helpful for mat-forming types that die out in the middle.","Aphids and whiteflies are attracted to veronica plants. These can be controlled with a blast of water from a garden hose or an application of insecticidal soap or neem oil.","Veronica is susceptible to foliar diseases such as powdery mildew and leaf spot. The best solution for these problems is prevention.","Veronica plants can be propagated by divisions in early spring or late summer. Lift the entire root ball with a shovel and use a sharp spade to divide it into sections that have both roots and top growth. Replant the divisions in the garden or containers.

In the shade, be mindful of foliar diseases like black spot.","Propagate viburnum using softwood or hardwood cuttings. Softwood cuttings taken in mid-to-late spring are easier to work with than hardwood cuttings taken in the fall. In either case, take a 6-inch cutting (for softwood) or a 10-inch cutting (for hardwood) from the plant. Remove the leaves from the bottom half of the cutting, dip the end in rooting hormone, and insert the cutting several inches into a planting medium of peat and perlite or similar.

When planting along with other perennials, avoid pairing yuccas with plants that need continuous water, as this is not an ideal environment for yuccas. While yuccas are tolerant of different soil conditions, including sand and clay, they must remain dry.","Yuccas are slow growers that live in a relatively stark environment. Still, they benefit from fertilization a couple of times a year with a low-nitrogen fertilizer—either granular or liquid. For the amount to use, follow product label instructions.","Yucca plants in the garden don't usually need any pruning except to remove a damaged or diseased area."

Keep the plant in a plastic pot with holes in the bottom for proper drainage, and place it inside a decorative pot without drainage. Remove your potted zebra plant from the decorative pot when it's time to water. Add water until it drains out the bottom, then place it back inside the decorative pot once it stops dripping.","Zebra plant needs warm temperatures for proper growth. Fortunately, their preferred temperatures are about the temperature range of most American homes, from the mid-60s to the mid-70s. High humidity is not necessary can be beneficial for the best growth. Kitchens and bathrooms tend to have higher humidity levels than other areas around the house, which can help improve plant health.","Fertilizer is necessary for most potted plants due to the leaching of nutrients from soils, and zebra plants are no exception. Feed your plants with a general-purpose water-soluble fertilizer once a month while plants are actively growing and blooming. ","Pruning zebra plants is generally not necessary, but spent flowers can be cut off to help plants redirect nutrients and energy into new growth. Allow leaves to naturally fall off the plant rather than cut them off. Plants naturally re-absorb and divert nutrients from older leaves prior to dropping them and removing them prior to this can sap nutrients from the plant and hinder further growth."

However, young plants need to grow in moist soil, so water deeply a couple of times a week. Don't overwater. Zinnias don't handle wet roots well.","Even though they grow best in well-drained soil high in organic matter, zinnias are tolerant of poor soils, including hard clay. Amend poor soil before planting for the best flower production.","Zinna seeds germinate between 70°F and 75°F. After germination, their preferred daily temperature is 75°F-85°F, although 65°F at night is acceptable. They aren't fond of high humidity but will tolerate it.","No matter where your zinnias grow (garden on container), they will benefit from a side dressing of 5-5-5 fertilizer when the flowers start to form. During the growing season, the occasional liquid fertilizer application helps them bloom all season long. Fertilizer is especially important in containers filled with a soilless potting medium. In all cases, follow the product instructions for the proper quantity.","Deadhead spent blooms regularly to keep the plant tidy and encourage additional blooms. To encourage branching and more flowers in tall varieties, pinch the growing tip from young plants. However, pinched plants will be shorter and may bloom later. No additional pruning is needed as these plants are annuals that must be replanted each year."
